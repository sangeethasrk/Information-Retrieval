Zipf (1949) observed that in a data collection the frequency
of a given word is inversely proportional to its rank. Zipf law inspired the classic method to generate stoplists. The size of the
stoplist corresponds to where an “elbow” appears in the plot. Looking at the graph for unigrams I would consider the 500 mmost common occuring words to be a part of my stoplist. as it is at 500 that the elbow appears.

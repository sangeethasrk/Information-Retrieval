renewable energy in germany - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
germany's renewable energy sector is among the most innovative and successful worldwide net-generation from renewable energy sources in the german electricity sector has increased from 6.3% in 2000 to about 30% in 2014 for the first time ever wind biogas and solar combined accounted for a larger portion of net electricity production than brown coal while peak-generation from combined wind and solar reached a new all-time high of 74% in april 2014 wind power saw its best day ever on december 12 2014 generating 562 gwh germany has been called the world's first major renewable energy economy
more than 23,000 wind turbines and 1.4 million solar pv systems are distributed all over the country's area of 357,000 square kilometers as of 2011 germany's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization with a particular focus on offshore wind farms a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern parts of the country
according to official figures some 370,000 people were employed in the renewable energy sector in 2010 especially in small and medium-sized companies this is an increase of around 8% compared to 2009 around 339,500 jobs and well over twice the number of jobs in 2004 160,500 about two-thirds of these jobs are attributed to the renewable energy sources act
germany's energy transition the energiewende designates a significant change in energy policy from 2011 the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation for example producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency


since the passage of the directive on electricity production from renewable energy sources in 1997 germany and the other states of the european union have been working towards a target of 12% renewable electricity by 2010 germany passed this target early in 2007 when the renewable energy share in electricity consumption in germany reached 14% in september 2010 the german government announced the following new ambitious energy targets: after the 2013 elections the new cdu csu and spd coalition government continued the energy transition with only minor modifications of its targets in the coalition agreement
the german government reported in 2011 renewable energy mainly wind turbines and biomass plants generated more than 123 terawatt-hours twh of electricity providing nearly 20% of the 603 twh of electricity supplied
in 2012 all renewable energy accounted for 21.9% of electricity with wind turbines and photovoltaic providing 11.9% of the total
chancellor angela merkel along with a vast majority of her compatriots believes as the first big industrialized nation we can achieve such a transformation toward efficient and renewable energies with all the opportunities that brings for exports developing new technologies and jobs
as of 2014 renewable sources account for 30.8% of the net electricity production first half-year compared to the same period of 2013 energy production from wind solar and biomass increased by 9.9 twh while it decreased from fossil fuels by 14.8 twh and remained almost unchanged for nuclear and hydro power
germany's primary energy consumption of 1,449 petajoules or 403 terawatt-hours refers to the total energy used by the nation the final energy consumption split by the sectors and with their relative share are:
as of the end of 2014 renewable energy sources such as biomass biogas biofuels hydro wind and solar accounted for 11.1% of the country's primary energy consumption a more than doubling compared to 2004 when renewables only contributed 4.5% renewable contribute most to the electricity sector with 27.8% gross-generation followed by the heat and transportation sector with 9.9% and 5.4% respectively
although the terms energy and electricity are often used interchangeably they should not be confused with one another as electricity is only one form of energy and does not account for the energy consumed by combustion engines and heat boilers used in transportation by vehicles and for the heating of buildings
in 2013 wind power generated a total of 53.4 twh of electricity and more than 3.2 gw of new capacity was added to the grid in 2011 the country's installed capacity of wind power reached 29,075 megawatts mw about 8% of the overall capacity according to ewea in a normal wind year installed wind capacity in germany will meet 10.6% at end 2011 and 9.3% at end 2010 of the german electricity needs
more than 21,607 wind turbines are located in the german federal area and the country has plans to build more as of 2011 germany's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization with a particular focus on offshore wind farms a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany
the government of germany as well as other european countries undertakes energetic policy which is going to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and provide more intensive exploitation of renewable energy sources for heating and cooling and electricity production which will pose no threat for the environment the key provider of biomass supply in germany is supposed to be agriculture moreover 25% of germany wood production is also used as a biomass feedstock the german federal research centre for forestry and forest products claims that there are also reserves which may assist in enlarging the part of forestry in biomass production agriculture is the main source of rapeseed oil which is used for the production of biodiesel and making substrates for the production of biogas
biomass used for the production of biogas and biofuels are some of germany's most important sources of renewable energy in 2010 biomass accounted for 30% of renewable electricity generation and for 70% of all renewable energy mostly wood
germany has committed to blending 6.25% biofuels in petroleum by 2014 with the biofuels quota act
solar photovoltaic pv technology generates electricity from sunlight and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications they've first become mass-produced in the year 2000 when german environmentalists and eurosolar have succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program in july 2012 a cumulative installed total solar pv power of 29.7 gw was in place solar pv provided 18 tw·h in 2011 3% of the total electricity demand as solar power installations rise quickly in first half of 2012 about 5.3% of the total electricity demand was covered by solar power on saturday may 25 2012 solar power broke a new record high feeding 22 gw into the power grid or as much as 20 nuclear power stations this jump above the 20 gw level was due to increased capacity and excellent weather conditions countrywide and made up for half of the nation's electricity demand at midday germany was also the biggest expanding market for solar pv 2012 with 7.6 gw of newly connected systems some market analysts expect the solar electricity share could reach 25% by 2050 price of pv systems has decreased more than 50% in 5 years since 2006
the total installed hydroelectic capacity in germany at the end of 2006 was 4.7 gw hydropower meets 3.5% of the electricity demand latest estimates show in germany in 2007 about 9,400 people were employed in the hydropower sector which generated a total turnover of €1.23 billion
geothermal power in germany is expected to grow mainly because of a law that benefits the production of geothermal electricity and guarantees a feed-in tariff but after a renewable energy law that introduced a tariff scheme of €0.15 us$0.23 per kilowatt-hour kwh for electricity produced from geothermal sources came into effect that year a construction boom was sparked and the new power pl

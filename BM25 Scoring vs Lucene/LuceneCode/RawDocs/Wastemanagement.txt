waste management - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
waste management is all those activities and action required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal this includes amongst other things collection transport treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation it also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling etc
the term usually relates to all kinds of waste whether generated during the extraction of raw materials the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products the consumption of final products or other human activities including municipal residential institutional commercial agricultural and special health care household hazardous wastes sewage sludge waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on health the environment or aesthetics
waste management practices are not uniform among countries developed and developing nations regions urban and rural area and sectors residential and industrial


there are a number of concepts about waste management which vary in their usage between countries or regions some of the most general widely used concepts include:
the waste hierarchy refers to the 3 rs reduce reuse and recycle which classify waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of waste minimisation the waste hierarchy remains the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies the aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste see: resource recoverythe waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is for policy to take action first and prevent the generation of waste the next step or preferred action is to reduce the generation of waste ie by re-use the next is recycling which would include composting following this step is material recovery and waste-to-energy energy can be recovered from processes ie landfill and combustion at this level of the hierarchy the final action is disposal in landfills or through incineration without energy recovery this last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented diverted or recovered the waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management the hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product
the life-cycle begins with design then proceeds through manufacture distribution use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reuse recovery recycling and disposal each of the above stages of the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention to rethink the need for the product to redesign to minimize waste potential to extend its use the key behind the life-cycle of a product is to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste
resource efficiency reflects the understanding that current global economic growth and development can not be sustained with the current production and consumption patterns globally we are extracting more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal this process of resource efficiency can address sustainability
the polluter pays principle is a principle where the polluting party pays for the impact caused to the environment with respect to waste management this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material
throughout most of history the amount of waste generated by humans was insignificant due to low population density and low societal levels of the exploitation of natural resources common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human biodegradable waste and these were released back into the ground locally with minimum environmental impact tools made out of wood or metal were generally reused or passed down through the generations
however some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others in particular the maya of central america had a fixed monthly ritual in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps
following the onset of industrialisation and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in england the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life the streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as 1751 when corbyn morris in london proposed that as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance it is proposed that the cleaning of this city should be put under one uniform public management and all the filth beconveyed by the thames to proper distance in the country
however it was not until the mid-19th century spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged highly influential in this new focus was the report the sanitary condition of the labouring population in 1842 of the social reformer edwin chadwick in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population
in the uk the nuisance removal and disease prevention act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in london the metropolitan board of works was the first city-wide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the public health act 1875 made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in moveable receptacles: for disposalâ€”the first concept for a dust-bin
the dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first incineration plants or as they were then called destructors in 1874 the first incinerator was built in nottingham by manlove alliott & co ltd to the design of albert fryer however these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas
similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of europe and north america in 1895 new york city became the first us city with public-sector garbage management
early garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses they became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in britain these were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck the garwood load packer was the first truck in 1938 to incorporate a hydraulic compactor
waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste some areas especially those in less developed countries do not have formal waste-collection systems
curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most european countries canada new zealand and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks this is often associated with curb-side waste segregation in rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility in some areas vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes systems are in use in europe and north america
pyrolysis is used to dispose of some wastes including tires a process that can produce recovered fuels steel and heat in some cases tires can provide the feedstock for cement manufacture such systems are used in usa california australia greece mexico the united kingdom and in israel the resem pyrolysis plant that has been operational at texas usa since december 2011 and processes up to 60 tons per day in some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste salvaging recyclables and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner in san francisco the local government established its mandatory recycling and composting ordinance in support of its goal of zero waste by 2020 requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill the three streams are collected with the curbside fantastic 3 bin system - blue for recyclables green for compostables and black for landfill-bound materials - provided to residents and businesses and serviced by san francisco's sole refuse hauler recology the city's pay-as-you-throw system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards the city's department of the environment's zero waste program has led the city to achieve 80% diversion the highest diversion rate in north america
in most developed countries domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income or notional house value commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs this practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling in some areas such as taipei the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce waste will only be collected by the city council if waste is disposed in government issued rubbish bags this policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate
disposal of waste in a landfill involves burying the waste and this remains a common practice in most countries landfills were often established in abandoned or unused quarries mining voids or borrow pits a properly designed and well-managed landfill can be a hygienic and relatively inexpensive method of disposing of waste materials older poorly designed or poorly managed landfills and open dumps can create a number of adverse environmental impacts such as wind-blown litter attraction of vermin and generation of liquid leachate another common product of landfills is gas mostly composed of methane and carbon dioxide which is produced from anaerobic breakdown of organic waste this gas can create odor problems kill surface vegetation and is a greenhouse gas
design characteristics of a modern landfill include methods to contain leachate such as clay or plastic lining material deposited waste is normally compacted to increase its density and stability and covered to prevent attracting vermin such as mice or rats many landfills also have landfill gas extraction systems installed to extract the landfill gas gas is pumped out of the landfill using perforated pipes and flared off or burnt in a gas engine to generate electricity
incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products this method is useful for disposal of residue of both solid waste management and solid residue from waste water management this process reduces the volumes of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as thermal treatment incinerators convert waste materials into heat gas steam and ash
incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry it is used to dispose of solid liquid and gaseous waste it is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous waste materials such as biological medical waste incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal due to issues such as emission of gaseous pollutants
incineration is common in countries such as japan where land is more scarce as these facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills waste-to-energy wte or energy-from-waste efw are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat steam or electricity combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks particular concern has focused on some very persistent organic compounds such as dioxins furans and pahs which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences
recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers the materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles a procedure called kerbside collection in some communities the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins eg for paper plastics metals prior to its collection in other communities all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection and the sorting is handled later at a central facility the latter method is known as single-stream recycling
the most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverages cans copper such as wire steel from food and aerosol cans old steel furnishings or equipment rubber tyres polyethylene and pet bottles glass bottles and jars paperboard cartons newspapers magazines and light paper and corrugated fiberboard boxes
pvc ldpe pp and ps see resin identification code are also recyclable these items are usually composed of a single type of material making them relatively easy to recycle into new products the recycling of complex products such as computers and electronic equipment is more difficult due to the additional dismantling and separation required
the type of material accepted for recycling varies by city and country each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials however certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed
recoverable materials that are organic in nature such as plant material food scraps and paper products can be recovered through composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter the resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes in addition waste gas from the process such as methane can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat chp cogeneration maximising efficiencies the intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter see resource recovery
energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat electricity or fuel through a variety of processes including combustion gasification pyrolyzation anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery this process is often called waste-to-energy energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills globally waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management
the energy content of waste products can

cost–benefit analysis - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
cost–benefit analysis cba sometimes called benefit–cost analysis bca is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives that satisfy transactions activities or functional requirements for a business it is a technique that is used to determine options that provide the best approach for the adoption and practice in terms of benefits in labor time and cost savings etc the cba is also defined as a systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a project decision or government policy hereafter project
broadly cba has two purposes:
cba is related to but distinct from cost-effectiveness analysis in cba benefits and costs are expressed in monetary terms and are adjusted for the time value of money so that all flows of benefits and flows of project costs over time which tend to occur at different points in time are expressed on a common basis in terms of their net present value
closely related but slightly different formal techniques include cost-effectiveness analysis cost–utility analysis risk–benefit analysis economic impact analysis fiscal impact analysis and social return on investment sroi analysis


cost–benefit analysis is often used by governments and other organizations such as private sector businesses to appraise the desirability of a given policy it is an analysis of the expected balance of benefits and costs including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo cba helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs and by how much relative to other alternatives ie one can rank alternate policies in terms of the cost–benefit ratio generally accurate cost–benefit analysis identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective assuming an accurate cba changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest cost–benefit ratio can improve pareto efficiency an analyst using cba should recognize that perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult and while cba can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed
the following is a list of steps that comprise a generic cost–benefit analysis
cba attempts to measure the positive or negative consequences of a project which may include:
a similar breakdown is employed in environmental analysis of total economic value both costs and benefits can be diverse financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data the net benefits of a project may incorporate cost savings or public willingness to pay compensation implying the public has no legal right to the benefits of the policy or willingness to accept compensation implying the public has a right to the benefits of the policy for the welfare change resulting from the policy the guiding principle of evaluating benefits is to list all categories of parties affected by an intervention and add the positive or negative value usually monetary that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare
the actual compensation an individual would require to have their welfare unchanged by a policy is inexact at best surveys stated preference techniques or market behavior revealed preference techniques are often used to estimate the compensation associated with a policy however survey respondents often have strong incentives to misreport their true preferences and market behavior does not provide any information about important non-market welfare impacts
one controversy is valuing a human life eg when assessing road safety measures or life-saving medicines however this can sometimes be avoided by using the related technique of cost-utility analysis in which benefits are expressed in non-monetary units such as quality-adjusted life years for example road safety can be measured in terms of cost per life saved without formally placing a financial value on the life however such non-monetary metrics have limited usefulness for evaluating policies with substantially different outcomes additionally many other benefits may accrue from the policy and metrics such as 'cost per life saved' may lead to a substantially different ranking of alternatives than traditional cost–benefit analysis
another controversy is valuing the environment which in the 21st century is typically assessed by valuing ecosystem services to humans such as air and water quality and pollution monetary values may also be assigned to other intangible effects such as business reputation market penetration or long-term enterprise strategy alignment
cba usually tries to put all relevant costs and benefits on a common temporal footing using time value of money calculations this is often done by converting the future expected streams of costs and benefits into a present value amount using a discount rate empirical studies and a technical framework suggest that in reality people do discount the future like this
the choice of discount rate is subjective a smaller rate values future generations equally with the current generation larger rates eg a market rate of return reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that they receive today more than money they get in the future the choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects one issue is the equity premium puzzle in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be if so then arguably market rates of return should not be used to determine a discount rate as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future eg climate change
risk associated with project outcomes is usually handled using probability theory this can be factored into the discount rate to have uncertainty increasing over time but is usually considered separately particular consideration is often given to risk aversion—the preference for avoiding loss over achieving gain expected return calculations do not account for the detrimental effect of uncertainty
uncertainty in cba parameters as opposed to risk of project failure etc can be evaluated using a sensitivity analysis which shows how results respond to parameter changes alternatively a more formal risk analysis can be undertaken using monte carlo simulations
the concept of cba dates back to an 1848 article by jules dupuit and was formalized in subsequent works by alfred marshall the corps of engineers initiated the use of cba in the us after the federal navigation act of 1936 effectively required cost–benefit analysis for proposed federal waterway infrastructure the flood control act of 1939 was instrumental in establishing cba as federal policy it demanded that the benefits to whomever they accrue be in excess of the estimated costs
the application for broader public policy started from the work of otto eckstein who in 1958 laid out a welfare economics foundation for cba and its application for water resource development over the 1960s cba was applied in the us for water quality recreation travel and land conservation during this period the concept of option value was developed to represent the non-tangible value of preserving resources such as national parks
cba was later expanded to address both intangible and tangible benefits of public policies relating to mental illness substance abuse college education and chemical waste policies in the us the national environmental policy act of 1969 first required the application of cba for regulatory programs and since then other governments have enacted similar rules government guidebooks for the application of cba to public policies include the canadian guide for regulatory analysis australian guide for regulation and finance us guide for health care programs and us guide for emergency management programs
cba application for transport investment started in the uk with the m1 motorway project in 1960 it was later applied on many projects including london underground's victoria line later the new approach to appraisal nata was introduced by the then department for tr

mains electricity - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
mains electricity is the general-purpose alternating-current ac electric power supply in the us mains electric power is referred to by several names including household power household electricity house current powerline domestic power wall power line power ac power city power street power and grid power
the two principal properties of the electric power supply voltage and frequency differ between regions a voltage of nominally 230 v and a frequency of 50 hz is used in europe most of africa most of asia most of south america and australia in north america the most common combination is 120 v and a frequency of 60 hz other voltages exist and some countries may have for example 230 v but 60 hz this is a concern to travelers since portable appliances designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate or may be destroyed by another
the use of different plugs and sockets in different regions provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements

worldwide many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting the different systems are primarily characterized by their
all these parameters vary among regions the voltages are generally in the range 100–240 v always expressed as root-mean-square voltage the two commonly used frequencies are 50 hz and 60 hz single-phase or three-phase power is most commonly used today although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century
foreign enclaves such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside eg in libya regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority with electric power provided by incompatible private sources
many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used with frequencies between 25 hz and 133 hz and voltages from 100 v to 250 v direct current dc has been almost completely displaced by alternating current ac in public power systems but dc was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century the modern combinations of 230 v 50 hz and 120 v 60 hz listed in iec 60038 did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal
industrial plants with three-phase power will have different higher voltages installed for large equipment and different sockets and plugs but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment
electricity is used for lighting heating cooling electric motors and electronic equipment the us energy information administration eia has published:
estimated us residential electricity consumption by end use for the year 2014
electronic appliances such as those included within the televisions computer and related equipment categories above representing 9% of the total typically use an ac to dc converter to power the device this is often capable of operation over the approximate range of 100 v to 250 v and at 50 hz to 60 hz the other categories are typically ac applications and usually have much more restricted input ranges
a study by the building research establishment in the uk suggests that the existing 230 v system is well suited to the future of electricity whether through design or darwinian processes any current perceived weakness is generally a result of cost reduction and market forces rather than any fundamental technical difficulties questions as to whether there are alternatives to the existing 230 v ac system are often overshadowed by legacy issues the future smart agenda and cost in all but specific situations where opportunities do exist they are often for specific parts of the overall load and often small parts in terms of total demand
in many countries household power is single-phase electric power with two or three wired contacts at each outlet neutral and line wires carry current and are defined as live parts
various earthing systems are used to ensure that the ground and neutral wires have the correct voltages to prevent shocks when touching grounded objects
in some installations there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a three wire single-phase circuit
small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables these exist with either two or three insulated conductors terminated in a plug which is then inserted into a fixed receptacle socket larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building for example in north american homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents higher voltages or three phase electric power these are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications
circuit breakers and fuses are used to detect short circuits between the line and neutral wires or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle overload protection to prevent overheating and fire these protective devices are usually mounted in a central panel--most commonly a distribution board or consumer unit--in a building but some wiring systems also provide an over current protection device at the socket or within the plug
residual-current devices also known as ground-fault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters are used to detect ground faults - leakage of current to somewhere other than the neutral and line wires like the ground wire or a person when a ground fault is detected the device quickly cuts off the circuit
in northern and central europe residential electrical supply is commonly 400 v three-phase electric power which gives 230 v between any phase and neutral house wiring is then a mix of three-phase and single-phase circuits high-power appliances such as kitchen stoves water heaters and maybe household power heavy tools like log splitters can then be supplied from the 400 v three-phase power supply
most of europe africa asia australia new zealand and most of south america use a supply that is within 6% of 230 v in the uk and australia the nominal supply voltage is 230 v +10% −6% to accommodate the fact that most supplies are in fact still 240 v japan taiwan saudi arabia north america central america and some parts of northern south america use a voltage between 100 v and 127 v the 230 v standard has become widespread so that 230 v equipment can be used in most parts of the world with the aid of an adapter or a change to the equipment's connection plug for the specific country
a distinction should be made between the voltage at the point of supply nominal system voltage and the voltage rating of the equipment utilization voltage typically the utilization voltage is 3% to 5% lower than the nominal system voltage for example a nominal 208 v supply system will be connected to motors with 200 v on their nameplates this allows for the voltage drop between equipment and supply voltages in this article are the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages
power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature voltages are expressed as root mean square rms voltage voltage tolerances are for steady-state operation momentary heavy loads or switching operations in the power distribution network may cause short-term deviations out of the tolerance band in general power supplies derived from large networks with many sources are more stable than those supplied to an isolated community with perhaps only a single generator
the choice of utilization voltage is due mor

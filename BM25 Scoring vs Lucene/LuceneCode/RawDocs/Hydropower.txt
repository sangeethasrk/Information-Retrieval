hydropower - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
hydropower or water power from the greek: ύδωρ water  is power derived from the energy of falling water or fast running water which may be harnessed for useful purposes since ancient times hydropower from many kinds of watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of various mechanical devices such as gristmills sawmills textile mills trip hammers dock cranes domestic lifts and ore mills a trompe which produces compressed air from falling water is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance
in the late 19th century hydropower became a source for generating electricity cragside in northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878 and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at niagara falls in 1879 in 1881 street lamps in the city of niagara falls were powered by hydropower
since the early 20th century the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of hydroelectric power international institutions such as the world bank view hydropower as a means for economic development without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere but in some cases dams environmental issues


in india water wheels and watermills were built in imperial rome water powered mills produced flour from grain and were also used for sawing timber and stone in china watermills were widely used since the han dynasty in china and the rest of the far east hydraulically operated pot wheel pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals
the power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as hushing the method was first used at the dolaucothi gold mines in wales from 75 ad onwards but had been developed in spain at such mines as las médulas hushing was also widely used in britain in the medieval and later periods to extract lead and tin ores it later evolved into hydraulic mining when used during the california gold rush
in the middle ages islamic mechanical engineer al-jazari described designs for 50 devices many of them water powered in his book the book of knowledge of ingenious mechanical devices including devices to serve wine clocks and five devices lift water from rivers or pools though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water these include an endless belt with jugs attached a cow-powered shadoof and a reciprocating device with hinged valves
in 1753 french engineer bernard forest de bélidor published architecture hydraulique which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines by the late nineteenth century the electric generator was developed by a team led by project managers and prominent pioneers of renewable energy jacob s gibbs and brinsley coleberd and could now be coupled with hydraulics the growing demand for the industrial revolution would drive development as well
at the beginning of the industrial revolution in britain water was the main source of power for new inventions such as richard arkwright's water frame although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations such as driving the bellows in small blast furnaces eg the dyfi furnace and gristmills such as those built at saint anthony falls which uses the 50-foot 15 m drop in the mississippi river
in the 1830s at the early peak in us canal-building hydropower provided the energy to transport barge traffic up and down steep hills using inclined plane railroads as railroads overtook canals for transportation canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems the history of lowell massachusetts is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization built upon the availability of water power
technological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed turbine or water motor in 1848 james b francis while working as head engineer of lowell's locks and canals company improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency he applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design his mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed confident design of high efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions the francis reaction turbine is still in wide use today in the 1870s deriving from uses in the california mining industry lester allan pelton developed the high efficiency pelton wheel impulse turbine which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous california interior
hydraulic power networks used pipes to carrying pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users the power source was normally a head of water which could also be assisted by a pump these were extensive in victorian cities in the united kingdom a hydraulic power network was also developed in geneva switzerland the world famous jet d'eau was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network
where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate compressed air directly without moving parts in these designs a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high level intake this is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped the height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber while an outlet submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake a separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air a facility on this principle was built on the montreal river at ragged shutes near cobalt ontario in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines
hydropower is used primarily to generate electricity broad categories include:
a conventional dammed-hydro facility hydroelectric dam is the most common type of hydroelectric power generation
hongping power station in hongping town shennongjia has a design typical for small hydro stations in the western part of china's hubei province water comes from the mountain behind the station through the black pipe seen in the photo
chief joseph dam near bridgeport washington us is a major run-of-the-river station without a sizeable reservoir
micro hydro in northwest vietnam
pumped-storage hydroelectricity – the upper reservoir llyn stwlan and dam of the ffestiniog pumped storage scheme in north wales the lower power station has four water turbines which generate 360 megawatts 480,000 hp of electricity within 60 seconds of the need arising
a hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available power power is a function of the hydraulic head and rate of fluid flow the head is the energy per unit weight or unit mass of water the static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head
the power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water the height of fall and the local acceleration due to gravity in si units the power is:

where
to illustrate power is calculated for a turbine that is 85% efficient with water at 1000 kg cubic metre 62.5 pounds cubic foot and a flow rate of 80 cubic-meters second 2800 cubic-feet second gravity of 9.81 metres per second squared and with a net head of 145 m 480 ft
in si units:
in english units the density is given in pounds per cubic foot so acceleration due to gravity is inherent in the unit of weight a conversion factor is required to change from foot lbs second to kilowatts:
operators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency procedures and definitions for ca

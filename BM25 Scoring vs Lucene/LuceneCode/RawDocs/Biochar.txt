biochar - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
biochar is charcoal used as a soil amendment like most charcoal biochar is made from biomass via pyrolysis biochar is under investigation as an approach to carbon sequestration to produce negative carbon dioxide emissions biochar thus has the potential to help mitigate climate change via carbon sequestration independently biochar can increase soil fertility of acidic soils low ph soils increase agricultural productivity and provide protection against some foliar and soil-borne diseases furthermore biochar reduces pressure on forests biochar is a stable solid rich in carbon and can endure in soil for thousands of years


pre-columbian amazonians are believed to have used biochar to enhance soil productivity they produced it by smoldering agricultural waste ie covering burning biomass with soil in pits or trenches european settlers called it terra preta de indio following observations and experiments a research team working in french guiana hypothesized that the amazonian earthworm pontoscolex corethrurus was the main agent of fine powdering and incorporation of charcoal debris to the mineral soil
the term “biochar” was coined by peter read to describe charcoal used as a soil improvement
biochar is a high-carbon fine-grained residue that today is produced through modern pyrolysis processes which is the direct thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen which prevents combustion to obtain an array of solid biochar liquid bio-oil and gas syngas products the specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process conditions such as temperature and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar temperatures of 400–500 °c 752–932 °f produce more char while temperatures above 700 °c 1,292 °f favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures typically requiring seconds instead of hours high temperature pyrolysis is also known as gasification and produces primarily syngas typical yields are 60% bio-oil 20% biochar and 20% syngas by comparison slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char ~50% once initialized both processes produce net energy for typical inputs the energy required to run a “fast” pyrolyzer is approximately 15% of the energy that it outputs modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 3–9 times the amount of energy required to run
the amazonian pit trench method harvests neither bio-oil nor syngas and releases a large amount of co2 black carbon and other greenhouse gases ghgs and potentially toxins into the air commercial-scale systems process agricultural waste paper byproducts and even municipal waste and typically eliminate these side effects by capturing and using the liquid and gas products
in a centralized system all biomass in a region is brought to a central plant for processing alternatively each farmer or group of farmers can operate a lower-tech kiln finally a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer can move from place to place to pyrolyze biomass vehicle power comes from the syngas stream while the biochar remains on the farm the biofuel is sent to a refinery or storage site factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts the amount of material to be processed and the ability to feed directly into the power grid
for crops that are not exclusively for biochar production the residue-to-product ratio rpr and the collection factor cf the percent of the residue not used for other things measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product for instance brazil harvests approximately 460 million tons mt of sugarcane annually with an rpr of 0.30 and a cf of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops which normally are burned in the field this translates into approximately 100 mt of residue annually which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives adding in the bagasse sugarcane waste rpr=0.29 cf=1.0 which is otherwise burned inefficiently in boilers raises the total to 230 mt of pyrolysis feedstock some plant residue however must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers
pyrolysis technologies for processing loose and leafy biomass produce both biochar and syngas
alternatively thermo-catalytic depolymerization which utilizes microwaves has recently been used to efficiently convert organic matter to biochar on an industrial scale producing ~50% char
the burning and natural decomposition of biomass and in particular agricultural waste adds large amounts of co 2 to the atmosphere biochar that is stable fixed and 'recalcitrant' carbon can store large amounts of greenhouse gases in the ground for centuries potentially reducing or stalling the growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels at the same time its presence in the earth can improve water quality increase soil fertility raise agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old-growth forests
biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years like coal such a carbon-negative technology would lead to a net withdrawal of co2 from the atmosphere while producing and consuming energy” this technique is advocated by prominent scientists such as james hansen head of the nasa goddard institute for space studies and james lovelock creator of the gaia hypothesis for mitigation of global warming by greenhouse gas remediation
researchers have estimated that sustainable use of biocharring could reduce the global net emissions of carbon dioxide co 2 methane and nitrous oxide by up to 1.8 pg co 2-c equivalent co 2-ce per year 12% of current anthropogenic co 2-ce emissions 1 pg=1 gt and total net emissions over the course of the next century by 130 pg co 2-ce without endangering food security habitat or soil conservation
biochar is recognised as offering a number of benefits for soil health many benefits are related to the extremely porous nature of biochar this structure is found to be very effective at retaining both water and water-soluble nutrients soil biologist elaine ingham indicates the extreme suitability of biochar as a habitat for many beneficial soil micro organisms she points out that when pre charged with these beneficial organisms biochar becomes an extremely effective soil amendment promoting good soil and in turn plant health
biochar has also been shown to reduce leaching of e-coli through sandy soils depending on application rate feedstock pyrolysis temperature soil moisture content soil texture and surface properties of the bacteria
for plants that require high potash and elevated ph biochar can be used as a soil amendment to improve yield
biochar can improve water quality reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases reduce nutrient leaching reduce soil acidity and reduce irrigation and fertilizer requirements biochar was also found under certain circumstances to induce plant systemic responses to foliar fungal diseases and to improve plant responses to diseases caused by soilborne pathogens
the various impacts of biochar can be dependent on the properties of the biochar as well as the amount applied and there is still a lack of knowledge about the important mechanisms and properties biochar impact may depend on regional conditions including soil type soil condition depleted or healthy temperature and humidity modest additions of biochar to soil reduce nitrous oxide n 2o emissions by up to 80% and eliminate methane emissions which are both more potent greenhouse gases than co2
studies have reported positive effects from biochar on crop production in degraded and nutrient–poor soils biochar can be designed with specific qualities to target distinct properties of soils biochar reduces leaching of critical nutrients creates a higher crop uptake of nutrients and provides greater soil availability of nutrients at 10% levels biochar reduced contaminant levels in plants by up to 80% while reducing total chlordane and ddx content in the plants by 68 and 79% respectively on the other hand because of its high adsorption capacity bioch

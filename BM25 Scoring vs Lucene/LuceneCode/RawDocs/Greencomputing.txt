green computing - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
green computing green ict as per ifg international federation of green ict and ifg standard green it or ict sustainability is the study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing or it san murugesan notes that this can include designing manufacturing using and disposing of computers servers and associated subsystems—such as monitors printers storage devices and networking and communications systems — efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment
the goals of green computing are similar to green chemistry: reduce the use of hazardous materials maximize energy efficiency during the product's lifetime and promote the recyclability or biodegradability of defunct products and factory waste green computing is important for all classes of systems ranging from handheld systems to large-scale data centers
many corporate it departments have green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of their it operations


in 1992 the us environmental protection agency launched energy star a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize energy-efficiency in monitors climate control equipment and other technologies this resulted in the widespread adoption of sleep mode among consumer electronics concurrently the swedish organization tco development launched the tco certification program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from crt-based computer displays this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption ergonomics and the use of hazardous materials in construction
the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on green icts ie information and communication technologies the environment and climate change the report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening icts themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation in general only 20% of initiatives have measurable targets with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations
many governmental agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing the energy star program was revised in october 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment along with a tiered ranking system for approved products
by 2008 26 us states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment the statutes either impose an advance recovery fee for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal
in 2010 the american recovery and reinvestment act arra was signed into legislation by president obama the bill allocated over $90 billion to be invested in green initiatives renewable energy smart grids energy efficiency etc in january 2010 the us energy department granted $47 million of the arra money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers the projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software improve power supply chain and data center cooling technologies
in a 2008 article san murugesan defined green computing as the study and practice of designing manufacturing using and disposing of computers servers and associated subsystems — such as monitors printers storage devices and networking and communications systems — efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment murugesan lays out four paths along which he believes the environmental effects of computing should be addressed: green use green disposal green design and green manufacturing green computing can also develop solutions that offer benefits by aligning all it processes and practices with the core principles of sustainability which are to reduce reuse and recycle and finding innovative ways to use it in business processes to deliver sustainability benefits across the enterprise and beyond
modern it systems rely upon a complicated mix of people networks and hardware as such a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well a solution may also need to address end user satisfaction management restructuring regulatory compliance and return on investment roi there are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption of the power management tools available one of the most powerful may still be simple plain common sense
gartner maintains that the pc manufacturing process accounts for 70% of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a pc more recently fujitsu released a life cycle assessment lca of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop's ecological footprint therefore the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment's lifetime another report from gartner recommends to look for product longevity including upgradability and modularity for instance manufacturing a new pc makes a far bigger ecological footprint than manufacturing a new ram module to upgrade an existing one
data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy accounting for between 1.1% and 1.5% of the world’s total energy use in 2010 1 the us department of energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings
energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center: from the it equipment to the hvac equipment to the actual location configuration and construction of the building
the us department of energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices:
additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the us department of energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat
energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data center’s space and increase performance and efficiency
the efficiency of algorithms has an impact on the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs algorithm changes such as switching from a slow eg linear search algorithm to a fast eg hashed or indexed search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero in 2009 a study by a physicist at harvard estimated that the average google search released 7 grams of carbon dioxide co₂ however google disputed this figure arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2 grams of co₂
algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive researchers from mit carnegie mellon university and akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs the researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed however this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used it reduces only the cost to the company using it nonetheless a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way a similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning
larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available local availability of renewable energy climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions
approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper network device management techniques are surveyed in the authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies namely i adaptive link rate alr ii interface proxying iii energy aware infrastructure and iv energy aware applications
computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware the concept originated with the ibm mainframe operating systems of the 1960s but was commercialized for x86-compatible computers only in the 1990s with virtualization a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single powerful system thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing intel corporation and amd have also built proprietary virtualization enhancements to the x86 instruction set into each of their cpu product lines in order to facilitate virtual computing
terminal servers have also been used in green computing when using the system users at a terminal connect to a central server all of the actual computing is done on the server but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal these can be combined with thin clients which use up to 1 8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption there has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs examples of terminal server software include terminal services for windows and the linux terminal server project ltsp for the linux operating system
the advanced configuration and power interface acpi an open industry standard allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware this allows a system to automatically turn off components such as monitors and hard drives after set periods of inactivity in addition a system may hibernate when most components including the cpu and the system ram are turned off acpi is a successor to an earlier intel-microsoft standard called advanced power management which allows a computer's bios to control power management functions
some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the cpu which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed this process is called undervolting some cpus can automatically undervolt the processor depending on the workload this technology is called speedstep on intel processors powernow cool'n'quiet on amd chips longhaul on via cpus and longrun with transmeta processors
data centers which have been criticized for their extraordinarily high energy demand are a primary focus for proponents of green computing data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers which results in lower energy usage the first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators the us federal government has set a minimum 10% reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011 with the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology google inc has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50% of that of the industry average
microsoft windows has included limited pc power management features since windows 95 these initially provided for stand-by suspend-to-ram and a monitor low power state further iterations of windows added hibernate suspend-to-disk and support for the acpi standard windows 2000 was the first nt-based operating system to include power management this required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model windows 2000 also introduced group policy a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most windows features however power management was not one of those features this is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings
this approach which is not compatible with windows group policy was repeated in windows xp the reasons for this design decision by microsoft are not known and it has resulted in heavy criticism microsoft significantly improved this in windows vista by redesigning the power management system to allow basic configuration by group policy the support offered is limited to a single per-computer policy the most recent release windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for timer coalescing processor power management and display panel brightness the most significant change in windows 7 is in the user experience the prominence of the default high performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power
there is a significant market in third-party pc power management software offering features beyond those present in the windows operating system available most products offer active directory integration and per-user per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans scheduled power plans anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting notable vendors include 1e nightwatchman data synergy powerman software faronics power save verdiem surveyor and enviprot auto shutdown manager
desktop computer power supplies psus are in general 70–75% efficient dissipating the remaining energy as heat a certification program called 80 plus certifies psus that are at least 80% efficient typically these models are drop-in replacements for older less efficient psus of the same form factor as of july 20 2007 all new energy star 4.0-certified desktop psus must be at least 80% efficient
smaller form factor eg 2.5 inch hard disk drives often consume less power per gigabyte than physically larger drives unlike hard disk drives solid-state drives store data in flash memory or dram with no moving parts power consumption may be reduced somewhat for low-capacity flash-based devices
in a recent case study fusion-io manufacturer of solid state storage devices managed to reduce the energy use and operating costs of myspace data centers by 80% while increasing performance speeds beyond that which had been attainable via multiple hard disk drives in raid 0 in response myspace was able to retire several of their servers
as hard drive prices have fallen storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online this includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage the increase in online storage has increased power consumption reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays while still providing the benefits of online storage is a subject of ongoing research
a fast gpu may be the largest power consumer in a computer
energy-efficient display options include:
crt monitors typically use more power than lcd monitors they also contain significant amounts of lead lcd monitors typically use a cold-cathode fluorescent bulb to provide light for the display some newer displays use an array of light-emitting diodes leds in place of the fluorescent bulb which reduces the amount of electricity used by the display fluorescent back-lights also contain mercury whereas led back-lights do not
recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead mercury and hexavalent chromium out of landfills and can also replace equipment that otherwise would need to be manufactured saving further energy and emissions computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations however many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment additionally parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets and municipal or private recycling centers computing supplies such as printer cartridges paper and b

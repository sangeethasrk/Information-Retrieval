microgeneration - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
microgeneration is the small-scale generation of heat and electric power by individuals small businesses and communities to meet their own needs as alternatives or supplements to traditional centralized grid-connected power although this may be motivated by practical considerations such as unreliable grid power or long distance from the electrical grid the term is mainly used currently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or low-carbon footprints or cost reduction it differs from micropower in that it is principally concerned with fixed power plants rather than for use with mobile devices


microgeneration technologies include small-scale wind turbines micro hydro solar pv systems microbial fuel cells ground source heat pumps and micro combined heat and power installations
in addition to the electricity production plant eg wind turbine and solar panel infrastructure for energy storage and power conversion and a hook-up to the regular electricity grid is usually needed and or foreseen although a hookup to the regular electricity grid is not essential it helps to decrease costs by allowing financial recompensation schemes in the developing world however the start-up cost for this equipment is generally too high thus leaving no choice but to opt for alternative set-ups
the whole of the equipment required to set up a working system and for an off-the-grid generation and or a hook up to the electricity grid herefore is termed a balance of system and is composed of the following parts with pv-systems:
a major issue with off-grid solar and wind systems is that the power is often needed when the sun is not shining or when the wind is calm this is generally not required for purely grid-connected systems:
or other means of energy storage eg hydrogen fuel cells flywheel energy storage pumped-storage hydroelectricity compressed air tanks 
for converting dc battery power into ac as required for many appliances or for feeding excess power into a commercial power grid:
usually in microgeneration for homes in the developing world a prefabricated house-wiring systems as wiring harnesses or prefabricated distribution units is used instead  simplified house-wiring boxes known as wiring harnesses can be simply bought and drilled in the wall without requiring much knowledge on the wiring itself as such even people without technical expertise are able to install them in addition they are also comparatively cheap and offer safety advantages
with wind turbines hydroelectric plants  the extra equipment needed is more or less the same as with pv-systems depending on the type of wind turbine used yet also include:
a new wind energy technology is being developed that converts energy from wind energy vibrations to electricity this energy called vibro-wind technology can use winds of less strength than normal wind turbines and can be placed in almost any location
a prototype consisted of a panel mounted with oscillators made out of pieces of foam the conversion from mechanical to electrical energy is done using a piezoelectric transducer a device made of a ceramic or polymer that emits electrons when stressed the building of this prototype was led by francis moon professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at cornell university moon's work in vibro-wind technology was funded by the atkinson center for a sustainable future at cornell
several microgeneration set-ups are possible these are:
all set-ups mentioned can work either on a single power plant or a combination of power plants in which case it is called a hybrid power system for safety grid-connected set-ups must automatically switch off or enter an anti-islanding mode when there is a failure of the mains power supply for more about this see the article on the condition of islanding
depending on the set-up chosen financial recompensation scheme power plant extra equipment prices may vary according to practical action microgeneration at home which uses the latest in cost saving-technology wiring harnesses ready boards cheap diy-power plants eg diy wind turbines the household expenditure can be extremely low-cost in fact practical action mentions that many households in farming communities in the developing world spend less than $1 for electricity per month  however if matters are handled less economically using more commercial systems approaches costs will be dramatically higher in most cases however financial advantage will still be done using microgeneration on renewable power plants often in the range of 50-90% as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the joule effect in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost
in the uk the government offers both grants and feedback payments to help businesses communities and private homes to install these technologies businesses can write the full cost of installation off against taxable profits whilst homeowners receive a flat rate grant or payments per kw h of electricity generated and paid back into the national grid community organisations can also receive up to £200,000 in grant funding
in the uk the microgeneration certification scheme provides approval for microgeneration installers and products which is a mandatory requirement of funding schemes such as the feed in tariffs and renewable heat incentive
grid parity or socket parity occurs when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost lcoe that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support it is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity
grid parity has been reached in some locations with on-shore wind power around 2000 and with solar power it was achieved for the first time in spain in 2013
can be used for heating purposes thus greatly increasing efficiency and offsetting energy total costs this method is known as micro combined heat and power microchp
it is used in some privately owned industrial combined heat and power chp installations it's also use in large-scale applications where it's called district heating and uses the heat that is normally exhausted by inefficient powerplants
microgeneration can dynamically balance the supply and demand for electric power by producing more power during periods of high demand and high grid prices and less power during periods of low demand and low grid prices this hybridized grid allows both microgeneration systems and large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than either could alone
microgeneration can be integrated as part of a self-sufficient house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems permaculture and agroecosystem rainwater harvesting composting toilets or even complete greywater treatment systems domestic microgeneration technologies include: photovoltaic solar systems small-scale wind turbines micro combined heat and power installations biodiesel and biogas
private generation decentralizes the generation of electricity and may also centralize the pooling of surplus energy while they have to be purchased solar shingles and panels are both available capital cost is high but saves in the long run with appropriate power conversion solar pv panels can run the same electric appliances as electricity from other sources
passive solar water heating is another effective method of utilizing solar power the simplest method is the solar or a black plastic bag set between 1 and 5 gallons out in the sun and allow to heat perfect for a quick warm shower
the ‘breadbox’ heater can be constructed easily with recycled materials and basic building experience consisting of a single or array of black tanks mounted inside a sturdy box insulated on the bottom and sides the lid either horizontal or angled to catch the most sun sh

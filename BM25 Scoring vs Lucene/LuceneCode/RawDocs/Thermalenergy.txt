thermal energy - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
in thermodynamics thermal energy refers to the internal energy present in a system due to its temperature the average translational kinetic energy possessed by free particles in a system of free particles in thermodynamic equilibrium as measured in the frame of reference of the center of mass of that system may also be referred to as the thermal energy per particle in thermodynamics it is often most convenient and precise to think of heat as the transfer of energy just as work is also a transfer of energy heat and work therefore depend on the path of transfer and are not state functions whereas internal energy is a state function
microscopically the thermal energy may include both the kinetic energy and potential energy of a system's constituent particles which may be atoms molecules electrons or particles it originates from the individually random or disordered motion of particles in a large ensemble in ideal monatomic gases thermal energy is entirely kinetic energy in other substances in cases where some of the thermal energy is stored in atomic vibration or by increased separation of particles having mutual forces of attraction the thermal energy is equally partitioned between potential energy and kinetic energy thermal energy is thus equally partitioned between all available degrees of freedom of the particles as noted these degrees of freedom may include pure translational motion in gases rotational motion vibrational motion and associated potential energies in general due to quantum mechanical reasons the availability of any such degrees of freedom is a function of the energy in the system and therefore depends on the temperature see heat capacity for discussion of this phenomenon
macroscopically the thermal energy of a system at a given temperature is proportional to its heat capacity however since the heat capacity differs according to whether or not constant volume or constant pressure is specified or phase changes permitted the heat capacity cannot be used to define thermal energy unless it is done in such a way as to ensure that only heat gain or loss not work makes any changes in the internal energy of the system usually this means specifying the constant volume heat capacity of the system so that no work is done also the heat capacity of a system for such purposes must not include heat absorbed by any chemical reaction or process


heat is the thermal energy transferred across a boundary of one region of matter to another as a process variable heat is a characteristic of a process not a property of the system it is not contained within the boundary of the system on the other hand thermal energy is a property of a system and exists on both sides of a boundary classically see ideal gas thermal energy is the statistical mean of the microscopic fluctuations of the kinetic energy of the systems' particles and it is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system boundary
according to the zeroth law of thermodynamics heat is exchanged between thermodynamic systems in thermal contact only if their temperatures are different if heat traverses the boundary in direction into the system the internal energy change is considered to be a positive quantity while exiting the system it is negative heat flows from the hotter to the colder system decreasing the thermal energy of the hotter system and increasing the thermal energy of the colder system then when the two systems have reached thermodynamic equilibrium they have the same temperature and the net exchange of thermal energy vanishes and heat flow ceases even after they reach thermal equilibrium thermal energy continues to be exchanged between systems but the net exchange of thermal energy is zero and therefore there is no heat
after the transfer the energy transferred by heat is called by other terms such as thermal energy or latent energy although heat often ends up as thermal energy after transfer it may cause changes other than a change in temperature for example the energy may be absorbed or released in phase transitions such as melting or evaporation which are the gain or loss of a form of potential energy called latent heat
thermal energy may be increased in a system by other means than heat for example when mechanical or electrical work is performed on the system heat flow may cause work to be performed on a system by compressing a system's volume for example a heat engine uses the movement of thermal energy heat flow to do mechanical work no qualitative difference exists between the thermal energy added by other means there is also no need in classical thermodynamics to characterize the thermal energy in terms of atomic or molecular behavior a change in thermal energy induced in a system is the product of the change in entropy and the temperature of the system
rather than being itself the thermal energy involved in a transfer heat is sometimes also understood as the process of that transfer ie heat functions as a verb
thermal energy is the portion of the thermodynamic or internal energy of a system that is responsible for the temperature of the system the thermal energy of a system scales with its size and is therefore an extensive property it is not a state function of the system unless the system has been constructed so that all changes in internal energy are due to changes in thermal energy as a result of heat transfer not work otherwise thermal energy is dependent on the way or method by which the system attained its temperature thermal energy can be transformed into and out of other types of energy and is not generally a conserved quantity
from a macroscopic thermodynamic description the thermal energy of a system is given by the product of its constant volume specific heat capacity ct and its absolute temperature t:
the heat capacity is a function of temperature itself and is typically measured and specified for certain standard conditions and a specific amount of substance molar heat capacity or mass units specific heat capacity at constant volume v cv it is the temperature coefficient of energy in practice given a narrow temperature range for example the operational range of a heat engine the heat capacity of a system is often constant and thus thermal energy changes are conveniently measured as temperature fluctuations in the system
in the microscopical description of statistical physics the thermal energy is identified with the mechanical kinetic energy of the constituent particles or other forms of kinetic energy associated with quantum-mechanical microstates
the distinguishing difference between the terms kinetic energy and thermal energy is that thermal energy is the mean energy of disordered ie random motion of the particles or the oscillations in the system the conversion of energy of ordered motion to thermal energy results from collisions
all kinetic energy is partitioned into the degrees of freedom of the system the average energy of a single particle with f quadratic degrees of freedom in a thermal bath of temperature t is a statistical mean energy given by the equipartition theorem as
where k is the boltzmann constant the total thermal energy of a sample of matter or a thermodynamic system is consequently the average sum of the kinetic energies of all particles in the system thus for a system of n particles its thermal energy is
for gaseous systems the factor f the number of degrees of freedom commonly has the value 3 in the case of the monatomic gas 5 for many diatomic gases and 7 for larger molecules at ambient temperatures in general however it is a function of the temperature of the system as internal modes of motion vibration or rotation become available in higher energy regimes
uthermal is not the total energy of a system physical systems also contains static potential energy such as chemical energy that arises from interactions between particles nuclear energy associated with atomic nuclei of particles and even the rest mass energy due to the equivalence of energy and mass
thermal energy is most easily defined in the context of the ideal gas which is well approximated by a monatomic

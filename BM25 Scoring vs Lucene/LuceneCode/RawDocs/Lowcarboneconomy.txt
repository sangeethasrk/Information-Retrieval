low-carbon economy - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
a low-carbon economy lce low-fossil-fuel economy lffe or decarbonised economy is an economy based on low carbon power sources that therefore has a minimal output of greenhouse gas ghg emissions into the environment biosphere but specifically refers to the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ghg emissions due to anthropogenic human activity are the dominant cause of observed global warmingclimate change since the mid-20th century continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes around the world increasing the likelihood of severe pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems
many countries around the world are designing and implementing low emission development strategies leds these strategies seek to achieve social economic and environmental development goals while reducing long-term greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to climate change impacts
globally implemented low-carbon economies are therefore proposed by those having drawn this conclusion as a means to avoid catastrophic climate change and as a precursor to the more advanced zero-carbon economy


nations may seek to become low-carbon or decarbonised economies as a part of a national climate change mitigation strategy a comprehensive strategy to mitigate climate change is through carbon neutrality
the aim of a lce is to integrate all aspects of itself from its manufacturing agriculture transportation and power-generation etc around technologies that produce energy and materials with little ghg emission and thus around populations buildings machines and devices that use those energies and materials efficiently and dispose of or recycle its wastes so as to have a minimal output of ghgs furthermore it has been proposed that to make the transition to an lce economically viable we would have to attribute a cost per unit output to ghgs through means such as emissions trading and or a carbon tax
some nations are presently low carbon: societies that are not heavily industrialised or populated in order to avoid climate change on a global level all nations considered carbon intensive societies and societies that are heavily populated might have to become zero-carbon societies and economies several of these countries have pledged to cut their emissions by 100% via offsetting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions carbon neutrality in other words emitting will not cease but will continue and will be offset to a different geographical area eu emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low-carbon developments
recent advances in technology and policy will allow renewable energy and energy efficiency to play major roles in displacing fossil fuels meeting global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions renewable energy technologies are being rapidly commercialized and in conjunction with efficiency gains can achieve far greater emissions reductions than either could independently
renewable energy is energy that comes from natural resources such as sunlight wind rain tides and geothermal heat which are renewable naturally replenished in 2008 about 19% of global final energy consumption came from renewables during the five years from the end of 2004 through 2009 worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies for wind power and many other renewable technologies growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years more wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology however grid-connected photovoltaics increased the fastest of all renewables technologies with a 60 percent annual average growth rate for the five-year period
energy efficiency gains in recent decades have been significant but there is still much more that can be achieved with a concerted effort and strong policies in place future energy efficiency improvements are likely to be very large heat is one of many forms of energy wastage that could be captured to significantly increase useful energy without burning more fossil fuels
biofuels in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials are entering the market driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security however many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment food security and land use
the challenge is to support biofuel development including the development of new cellulosic technologies with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in africa latin america and asia
biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions however they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation a healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels especially in the transport sector using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy
nuclear power has been offered as the primary means to achieve a lce in terms of large industrialized nations mainland france due primarily to 75% of its electricity being produced by nuclear power has the lowest carbon dioxide production per unit of gdp in the world and it is the largest exporter of electricity in the world earning it approximately €3 billion annually in sales
concern is often expressed with the matter of spent nuclear fuel storage and security although the physical issues are not large the political difficulties are significant the liquid fluoride thorium reactor lftr has been suggested as a solution to the concerns posed by conventional nuclear
one proposal from karlsruhe university developed as a virtual power station is the use of solar and wind energy for base load with hydro and biogas for make up or peak load hydro and biogas are used as energy storage this requires the development of a smart intelligent grid hopefully including local power networks than use energy near the site of production thereby minimising electrical grid losses
a further development of this is the use of the carbon capture hydrogen and its conversion into methane sng synthetic natural gas to act as a storage for intermittent renewables
co2 + 4h2 → ch4 + 2h2o sabatier reaction
this involves the use of the existing natural gas methane grid as the store in this case the carbon dioxide is given economic value as a component of energy carrier this solar fuel cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy that cannot be used instantaneously in the grid which otherwise would be wasted to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water the hydrogen is then combined with co2 to create synthetic or substitute natural gas sng and stored in the natural gas network the natural gas is used to create electrical energy and the heat used as well in chp on demand when there is not enough sun photovoltaic csp or wind turbines or water hydro ocean current waves the german natural gas grid for example has two months of storage more than enough to outlast renewable energy low production points
the proposed strategy of carbon capture and storage ccs - continued use of non-renewable fossil fuels but without allowing carbon dioxide to reach the atmosphere - has also been considered as a means to achieve a lce either in a primary or supporting role major concerns include the uncertainty of costs and time needed to successfully implement ccs worldwide and with guarantees that stored emissions will not leak into the biosphere
combined heat and power chp is a technology which by allowing the more efficient use of fuel will at least reduce carbon emissions should the fuel be biomass or biogas or hydrogen used as an energy store then in principle it can be a zero carbon option chp can also be used with a nuclear reactor as the energy source there are examples of such installations in the far north of the russian federation
most of the agricultural facilities in the developed world are mechanized due to rural electrification rural electrification has produced significant productivity gains but it also uses a lot of energy for this and other reasons such as transport costs in a low-carbon society rural areas would need available supplies of renewably produced electricity
irrigation can be one of the main components of an agricultural facility's energy consumption in parts of california it can be up to 90% in the low carbon economy irrigation equipment will be maintained and continuously updated and farms will use less irrigation water
different crops require different amounts of energy input for example glasshouse crops irrigated crops and orchards require a lot of energy to maintain while row crops and field crops do not need as much maintenance those glasshouse and irrigated crops that do exist will incorporate the following improvements:
glasshouse crops
irrigated arable crops
livestock operations can also use a lot of energy depending on how they are run feed lots use animal feed made from corn soybeans and other crops energy must be expended to produce these crops process and transport them free-range animals find their own vegetation to feed on the farmer may expend energy to take care of that vegetation but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops
many livestock operations currently use a lot of energy to water their livestock in the low-carbon economy such operations will use more water conservation methods such as rainwater collection water cisterns etc and they will also pump distribute that water with on-site renewable energy sources most likely wind and solar
due to rural electrification most agricultural facilities in the developed world use a lot of electricity in a low-carbon economy farms will be run and equipped to allow for greater energy efficiency the dairy industry for example will incorporate the following changes:
irrigated dairy
fishing is quite energy intensive improvements such as heat recovery on refrigeration and trawl net technology will be common in the low-carbon economy
protecting forests provides integrated benefits to all ranging from increased food production safeguarded local livelihoods protected biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests and reduced rural poverty adopting low emission strategies for both agricultural and forest production also mitigates some of the effects of climate change
in the low-carbon economy forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil-based carbon reserves too much specialized tree farms will be the main source of material for many products quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output
flaring and venting of natural gas in oil wells is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three-quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the 1970s of approximately 110 million metric tons year and in 2004 accounted for about 1 2 of one percent of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions
the world bank estimates that 134 billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually 2010 datum an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of germany and france or enough to supply the entire world with gas for 16 days this flaring is highly concentrated: 10 countries account for 70% of emissions and twenty for 85%
the top-ten leading contributors to world gas flaring in 2010 were in declining order: russia 26% nigeria 11% iran 8% iraq 7% algeria 4% angola 3% kazakhstan 3% libya 3% saudi arabia 3% and venezuela 2%
retail operations in the low-carbon economy will have several new features one will be high-efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent halogen and eventually led light sources many retail stores will also feature roof-top solar panel arrays these make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer these are the same times that electricity is the most expensive and also the same times that stores use the most electricity
sustainable low-carbon transport systems are based on minimizing travel and shifting to more environmentally as well as socially and economically sustainable mobility improving transport technologies fuels and institutions decarbonisation of urban mobility by means of:
there have been some moves to investigate the ways and extent to which health systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and how they may need to change to become part of a low-carbon world the sustainable development unit of the nhs in the uk is one of the first official bodies to have been set up in this area whilst organisations such as the campaign for greener healthcare are also producing influential changes at a clinical level this work includes
some of the suggested changes needed are:
a good overview of the history of international efforts towards a low-carbon economy from its initial seed at the inaugural un conference on the human environment in stockholm in 1972 has been given by david runnals on the international scene the most prominent early step in the direction of a low-carbon economy was the signing of the kyoto protocol which came into force on february 16 2005 under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions importantly all member nations of the organization for economic co-operation and development except the united states have ratified the protocol europe is the leading geopolitical continent in defining and mobilising decarbonisation policies for instance the uitp - an organisation advocating sustainable mobility and public transport - has an eu office but less well developed contacts with for example the us the european union committee of the uitp wants to promote decarbonisation of urban mobility in europe although europe is nowadays the leading geopolitical continent with regard to lowering emissions europe is quickly losing ground to asia with countries such as china and south korea however the 2014 global green economy index™ ggei ranks 60 nations on their green economic performance finding that the nordic countries and switzerland have the best combined performance around climate change and green economy
costa rica sources much of its energy needs from renewables and is undertaking reforestation projects in 2007 the costa rican government announced the commitment for costa rica to become the first carbon neutral country by 2021
iceland began utilising renewable energy early in the 20th century and so since has been a low-carbon economy however since dramatic economic growth iceland's emissions have increased significantly per capita as of 2009 iceland energy is sourced from mostly geothermal energy and hydropower renewable energy in iceland and since 1999 has provided over 70% of the nation's primary energy and 99.9% of iceland's electricity as a result of this iceland's carbon emissions per capita are 62% lower than those of the united states despite using more primary energy per capita due to the fact that it is renewable and low-cost iceland seeks carbon neutrality and expects to use 100% renewable energy by 2050 by generating hydrogen fuel from renewable energy sources
australia has implemented schemes to start the transition to a low-carbon economy but carbon neutrality has not been mentioned and since the introduction of the schemes emissions have increased the second rudd government pledged to lower emissions by 5-15% in 2001 the howard government introduced a mandatory renewable energy target mret scheme in 2007 the government revised the mret - 20 percent of australia's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by 2020 renewable energy sources provide 8-10% of the nation's energy and this figure will increase significantly in the coming years however coal depe

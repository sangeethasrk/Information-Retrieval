fuel - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
a fuel is any material that can be made to react so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work the concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy via nuclear fission or nuclear fusion
the heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine other times the heat itself is valued for warmth cooking or industrial processes as well as the illumination that comes with combustion fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy hydrocarbons and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans but other substances including radioactive metals are also utilized
fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy such as those that directly release electrical energy such as batteries and capacitors or mechanical energy such as flywheels springs compressed air or water in a reservoir


the first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by homo erectus near 2,000,000 two million years ago throughout most of human history fuels derived from plants or animal fat were only used by humans  charcoal a wood derivative has been used since at least 6,000 bce for melting metals it was only supplanted by coke derived from coal as european forests started to become depleted around the 18th century charcoal briquettes are now commonly used as a fuel for barbecue cooking
coal was first used as a fuel around 1000 bce in china with the energy in the form of chemical energy that could be released through combustion but the concept development of the steam engine in the united kingdom in 1769 coal came into more common use as a power source coal was later used to drive ships and locomotives by the 19th century gas extracted from coal was being used for street lighting in london in the 20th and 21st centuries the primary use of coal is to generate electricity providing 40% of the world's electrical power supply in 2005
fossil fuels were rapidly adopted during the industrial revolution because they were more concentrated and flexible than traditional energy sources such as water power they have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power
currently the trend has been towards renewable fuels such as biofuels like alcohols
chemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them most notably by the process of combustion most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen
chemical fuels are divided in two ways first by their physical properties as a solid liquid or gas secondly on the basis of their occurrence: primary natural fuel and secondary artificial fuel thus a general classification of chemical fuels is:
solid fuel refers to various types of solid material that are used as fuel to produce energy and provide heating usually released through combustion solid fuels include wood see wood fuel charcoal peat coal hexamine fuel tablets and pellets made from wood see wood pellets corn wheat rye and other grains solid-fuel rocket technology also uses solid fuel see solid propellants solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to create fire coal was the fuel source which enabled the industrial revolution from firing furnaces to running steam engines wood was also extensively used to run steam locomotives both peat and coal are still used in electricity generation today the use of some solid fuels eg coal is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions the use of other solid fuels such as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves in some areas smokeless coal is often the only solid fuel used in ireland peat briquettes are used as smokeless fuel they are also used to start a coal fire
liquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create mechanical energy usually producing kinetic energy they also must take the shape of their container it is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid
most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth's crust however there are several types such as hydrogen fuel for automotive uses ethanol jet fuel and biodiesel which are all categorized as a liquid fuel emulsified fuels of oil-in-water such as orimulsion have been developed a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy
some common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled with relative ease also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and home use fuels like kerosene are rationed in some countries for example available in government subsidized shops in india for home use
conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum kerosene is used in kerosene lamps and as a fuel for cooking heating and small engines natural gas composed chiefly of methane can be compressed to a liquid and used as a substitute for other traditional liquid fuels lp gas is a mixture of propane and butane both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions it offers many of the advantages of compressed natural gas cng but is denser than air does not burn as cleanly and is much more easily compressed commonly used for cooking and space heating lp gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally
fuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that under ordinary conditions are gaseous many fuel gases are composed of hydrocarbons such as methane or propane hydrogen carbon monoxide or mixtures thereof such gases are sources of potential heat energy or light energy that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption fuel gas is contrasted with liquid fuels and from solid fuels though some fuel gases are liquefied for storage or transport while their gaseous nature can be advantageous avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels it can also be dangerous it is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas leading to the risk of a gas explosion for this reason odorizers are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell the most common type of fuel gas in current use is natural gas
biofuel can be broadly defined as solid liquid or gas fuel consisting of or derived from biomass biomass can also be used directly for heating or power—known as biomass fuel biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly eg plants many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture
perhaps the earliest fuel employed by humans is wood evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at swartkrans south africa it is unknown which hominid species first used fire as both australopithecus and an early species of homo were present at the sites as a fuel wood has remained in use up until the present day although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources wood has an energy density of 10–20 mj kg
recently biofuels have been developed for use in automotive transport for example bioethanol and biodiesel but there is widespread public debate about how carbon efficient these fuels are
fossil fuels are hydrocarbons primarily coal and petroleum liquid petroleum or natural gas forme

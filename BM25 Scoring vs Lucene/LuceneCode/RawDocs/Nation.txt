nation from latin: natio people tribe kin genus class flock is a social concept with no uncontroversial definition but that is most commonly used to designate larger groups or collectives of people with common characteristics attributed to them—including language traditions customs mores habits habitus and ethnicity a nation by comparison is more impersonal abstract and overtly political than an ethnic group it is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy unity and particular interests
according to jughashvili's national question: a nation is not a racial or tribal but a historically constituted community of people a nation is not a casual or ephemeral conglomeration but a stable community of people a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse as a result of people living together generation after generation and in its entirety: a nation is a historically constituted stable community of people formed on the basis of a common language territory economic life and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture
the nation has been described by benedict anderson as an imagined community and by paul james as an abstract community it is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections it is an abstract community in the sense that it is objectively impersonal even if each individual in the nation experiences him or herself as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others for the most part members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will never likely meet hence the phrase a nation of strangers used by such writers as vance packard


the word nation came to english from the old french word nacion which in turn originates from the latin word natio nātĭō literally meaning birth

although some scholars of nationalism argue that nations are a modern phenomenon arising around the time of the french revolution other scholars assert that nations are an old or even an ancient type of political formation political scientist azar gat argues that ancient egypt was the world's first national state emerging quite early as a unified state congruent with a distinct people of shared ethnicity
gat goes on to argue that the next group of national states to emerge were in the ancient levant citing steven grosby's book biblical ideas of nationality: ancient and modern as an effective demonstration of the emergence of nations in israel ammon moab and edom a process of nation-formation provoked by the threat of conquest by the assyrian empire in particular gans cites hans kohn's the idea of nationalism: a study in its origins and background 1944 pp 27–30 as an early scholarly treatment of the idea that ancient israel was an example of a premodern nation

another prudent example of medieval nationalism is the declaration of arbroath a document produced by scottish nobles and clergy during the scottish wars of independence the purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the pope that scotland was indeed a nation of its own with its own unique culture history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than england the document went onto justify the actions of robert the bruce and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the english for having violated scottish sovereignty without justification the propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the bruce which after the battle of bannockburn was successful and eventually resulted in the end of england's occupation and recognition of scottish independence on the part of the english crown the document is widely seen as an early example of both scottish nationalism and popular sovereignty

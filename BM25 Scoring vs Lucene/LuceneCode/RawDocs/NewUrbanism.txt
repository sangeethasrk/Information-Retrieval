new urbanism - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
new urbanism is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types it arose in the united states in the early 1980s and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development urban planning and municipal land-use strategies
new urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to world war ii it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design tnd and transit-oriented development tod these ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices
the organizing body for new urbanism is the congress for the new urbanism founded in 1993 its foundational text is the charter of the new urbanism which begins:
we advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history climate ecology and building practice
new urbanists support: regional planning for open space context-appropriate architecture and planning adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities libraries and community centres and the balanced development of jobs and housing they believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes walk or take the train they also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl the charter of the new urbanism also covers issues such as historic preservation safe streets green building and the re-development of brownfield land the ten principles of intelligent urbanism also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches
architecturally new urbanist developments are often accompanied by new classical postmodern or vernacular styles although that is not always the case


until the mid 20th century cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods for most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable although with the development of mass transit the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs but with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car specifically after world war ii urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class the physical separation of where people live from where they work shop and frequently spend their recreational time together with low housing density which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency
this new system of development with its rigorous separation of uses arose after world war ii and became known as conventional suburban development or pejoratively as urban sprawl the majority of us citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last fifty years and automobile use per capita has soared
although new urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the modernist planning techniques being put into practice social philosopher and historian lewis mumford criticized the anti-urban development of post-war america the death and life of great american cities written by jane jacobs in the early 1960s called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects large car-dependent thoroughfares and segregated commercial centers that had become the norm
rooted in these early dissenters the ideas behind new urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the european city proposed by architect leon krier and the pattern language theories of christopher alexander the term new urbanism itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized
in 1991 the local government commission a private nonprofit group in sacramento california invited architects peter calthorpe michael corbett andrés duany elizabeth moule elizabeth plater-zyberk stefanos polyzoides and daniel solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning named the ahwahnee principles after yosemite national park's ahwahnee hotel the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991 at its first yosemite conference for local elected officials
calthorpe duany moule plater-zyberk polyzoides and solomon founded the chicago-based congress for the new urbanism in 1993 the cnu has grown to more than three thousand members and is the leading international organization promoting new urbanist design principles it holds annual congresses in various us cities
in 2009 co-founders elizabeth moule hank dittmar and stefanos polyzoides authored the canons of sustainable architecture and urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between new urbanism and sustainability the canons are a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building the making of community and the conservation of our natural world they promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions the use of locally obtained materials and in general a culture of permanence
new urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales and while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant new urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning architecture and public policy
andrés duany and elizabeth plater-zyberk two of the founders of the congress for the new urbanism observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops front porches and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the victorian neighborhoods of new haven connecticut they and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:
several terms are viewed either as synonymous included in or overlapping with the new urbanism the terms neotraditional development or traditional neighborhood development are often associated with the new urbanism these terms generally refer to complete new towns or new neighborhoods often built in traditional architectural styles as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects the term traditional urbanism has also been used to describe the new urbanism by those who object to the new moniker the term walkable urbanism was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor christopher leinberger many debate whether smart growth and the new urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements placemaking is another term that is often used to signify new urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups the term transit-oriented development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent new urbanist peter calthorpe and is heavily promoted by new urbanists the term sustainable development is sometimes associated with the new urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of new urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s however this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the united nations and agenda 21 to include human development issues eg developing country that exceed the scope of land development intended to be addressed by the new urbanism or sustainable urbanism the term livability or livable communities has also become popular under us president barack obama's administration though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the local government commission
planning magazine discussed the proliferation of urbanisms in an article in 2011 titled a short guide to 60 of the newest urbanisms several new urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the new urbanism including sustainable urbanism and tactical urbanism of which guerrilla urbanism can be viewed as a subset the term tactical urbanism was coined by frenchman michel de certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by new urbanist mike lydon and the co-authors of the tactical urbanism guide in 2011 andres duany authored a book that used the term agrarian urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of new urbanist town design in 2013 a group of new urbanists led by cnu co-founder andres duany began a research project under the banner of lean urbanism which purported to provide a bridge between tactical urbanism and the new urbanism
other terms have surfaced in reaction to the new urbanism intended to provide a contrast alternative to or a refinement of the new urbanism some of these terms include everyday urbanism by harvard professor margaret crawford john chase and john kaliski ecological urbanism and true urbanism by architect bernard zyscovich landscape urbanism was popularized by charles waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the new urbanism in his lectures at harvard university a book called landscape urbanism and its discontents edited by andres duany and emily talen specifically addressed the tension between these two views of urbanism michael e arth promotes what he describes as a variant of the new urbanism called the new pedestrianism which is intended to be a more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 planned community in radburn new jersey
the primary organization promoting the new urbanism in the united states is the congress for the new urbanism cnu the congress for the new urbanism cnu is the leading organization promoting walkable mixed-use neighborhood development sustainable communities and healthier living conditions cnu members promote the principles of cnu's charter and the hallmarks of new urbanism including:

on the other hand journalist alex marshall has decried new urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty aspirational slogans in a 1996 article in metropolis magazine marshall denounced new urbanism as a grand fraud the attack continued in numerous articles including an opinion column in the washington post in september of the same year and in marshall's first book how cities work: suburbs sprawl and the roads not taken
critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the new urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments but the argument that new urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in canada
some parties have criticized the new urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking cycling and public transport the charter of the new urbanism states that communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of car-free developments michael e arth proposes new pedestrianism as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths steve melia proposes the idea of filtered permeability see permeability spatial and transport planning which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limited the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime
in response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the new urbanism's claimed environmental benefits a rating system for neighborhood environmental design leed-nd was developed by the us green building council natural resources defense council and the congress for the new urbanism to quantify the sustainability of new urbanist neighborhood design new urbanist and board member of cnu doug farr has taken a step further and coined sustainable urbanism which combines new urbanism and leed-nd to create walkable transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure

ecolabel - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
eco-labels and green stickers are labeling systems for food and consumer products ecolabels are voluntary but green stickers are mandated by law for example in north america major appliances and automobiles use energy star they are a form of sustainability measurement directed at consumers intended to make it easy to take environmental concerns into account when shopping some labels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of measurement while others assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum requirements for sustainability or reduction of harm to the environment many ecolabels are focused on minimising the negative ecological impacts of primary production or resource extraction in a given sector or commodity through a set of good practices that are captured in a sustainability standard through a verification process usually referred to as certification a farm forest fishery orbel
ecolabelling systems exist for both food and consumer products both systems were started by ngos since then the european union have developed legislation for conduct of ecolabelling and also have created their own ecolabels one for food and one for consumer products at least for food the ecolabel is nearly identical with the common ngo definition of the rules for ecolabelling label trust is an issue for consumers because as manufacturers and manufacturing associations have set up rubber stamp labels to greenwash their products with fake ecolabels high trust levels can be created when ecolabels apply for governmental recognition as formal certification marks recognized by logos or names with 'ctm' cm or 'certtm' typically this means schemes approved as a certification mark have had the government department responsible declare that the scheme has a standard and certifies that they are 'competent to certify' the highest trust levels would be a government recognized certification mark that was also compliant with key iso standards especially iso 14024- type 1 ecolabels that undertake iso 14040 compliant life cycle analysis as part of their assessment


the last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space there is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs the international organization for standardization iso has created standards for labeling practices within the iso 14000 schema iso 14020 to 14025 series deals with environmental labels and declarations
consumer desires for sustainable consumption is driving the global marketplace with desire to regulate product production the globalization of economies is shifting control of sustainability away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument ecolabelling
the only ecolabel that takes into consideration legal and infrastructural limitations is which is a startup in greece approved by the university of wales and which has the support of the dutch embassy and the orange grove it is a certification programme with the intention to increase owner staff suppliers and stakeholder’s awareness with the intention to motivate them for an eco-friendly action towards a sustainable holiday and future for all of us in the long run and through which expenses can be minimized
eco-labeling standardization is a new form of regulation which is voluntary in nature but impose upon large companies market forces in order to harmonize production of goods and services with stronger ecological practices recently it has turned into a new form of non-state authority at both national and international levels this idea of entrepreneurial democracy based on the success of the iso 14000 standards on the management of environmental quality and the iso 9000 standards on quality production control once an industry sector decides to get this certification it has to provide evidences of documented proof of compliance required in terms of iso 14042 standard it is obligatorily for all applicants to respect environmental legislation and related legislation breaching of any laws may result in licensing suspension
during the un earth summit conference in 1992 an international consensus was generated to integrate environmental issues into manufacturing procedures the idea was to manipulate consumption patterns in order to achieve sustainable development the result of this is as follows
currently in the developed world: eco-labels and green stickers have evolved to play a vital role they provide a verifiable link between products and informed consumer wishes this approach applies market pressure on industries to minimize their environmental impact this is evidenced by growth in population of informed consumers marketing strategists are responding with green certifications and its abuse greenwashing
currently in the developing world: first consumers became concerned about the quality safety and environmental sustainability of food and supported demand for green foods then focused on the environmental effects of agriculture and globalization of food production which lead to the exposure of globally controlled food regimes consumer advocate groups responded with a call for alternative food networks this gives a new dimension to consumer demands and corporate competitiveness australian consumer association choice confronted corporate interests with their concerns about growing interests in green consumption food production use of pesticides organic production and genetic modification etc
green stickers on consumer goods have been evolving since the 1970s the main drivers have been energy and fuel consumption these stickers first started appearing on major appliances after government agencies in the united states and canada legislated their requirement manufacturers are also required to meet minimum standards of energy use the automobile industry in north america is required to meet a minimum emissions standard this led to fuel efficiency labels being placed on new automobiles sold the major appliance manufactures were required to use standard testing practices and place clear labels on products the international organization for standardization has developed standards for addressing environmental labelling with the iso 14000 family which grew out of iso's commitment to support the objective of sustainable development discussed at the united nations conference on environment and development in rio de janeiro in 1992
green labelling worldwide is moving beyond traditional country borders most of these initiatives are voluntary eco-labels however there is an initiative under way in north america to broaden the scope of green stickers to include other consumer goods
governments of many countries have environmental protection agencies these agencies are mandated watchdogs of industry and regulate releasing chemical pollution into the environment some of them administer labelling standards other set minimum requirements for manufacturers
the office of energy efficiency oee run by the department of natural resources canada regulates both the automobile and appliance manufacturers energuide label for vehicles found on all new passenger cars light-duty vans pickup trucks and special purpose vehicles not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of 3855 kg 8500 lb the label shows the city and highway fuel consumption ratings and an estimated annual fuel cost for that particular vehicle federal law in canada under canada's energy efficiency regulationsrequires that the energuide label be placed on all new electrical appliances manufactured in or imported into canada and that the label indicate the amount of electricity used by that appliance this information is determined by standardized test procedures a third-party agency verifies that an appliance meets canada's minimum energy performance levels
all major home appliances must meet the appliance standards program set by the us department of energy doe on cooperation with the us federal trade commissio

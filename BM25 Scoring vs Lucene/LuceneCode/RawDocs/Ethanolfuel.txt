ethanol fuel - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
ethanol fuel is ethyl alcohol the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages it is most often used as a motor fuel mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline the first production car running entirely on ethanol was the fiat 147 introduced in 1978 in brazil by fiat nowadays cars are able to run using 100% ethanol fuel or a mix of ethanol and gasoline aka flex-fuel it is commonly made from biomass such as corn or sugarcane world ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17 billion to more than 52 billion liters from 2007 to 2008 the share of ethanol in global gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7% to 5.4% in 2011 worldwide ethanol fuel production reached 22.36 billion us liquid gallons bg 84.6 billion liters with the united states as the top producer with 13.9 bg 52.6 billion liters accounting for 62.2% of global production followed by brazil with 5.6 bg 21.1 billion liters ethanol fuel has a gasoline gallon equivalency gge value of 1.5 us gallons 5.7 l which means 1.5 gallons of ethanol produces the energy of one gallon of gasoline
ethanol fuel is widely used in brazil and in the united states and together both countries were responsible for 87.1% of the world's ethanol fuel production in 2011 most cars on the road today in the us can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol and ethanol represented 10% of the us gasoline fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011 since 1976 the brazilian government has made it mandatory to blend ethanol with gasoline and since 2007 the legal blend is around 25% ethanol and 75% gasoline e25 by december 2011 brazil had a fleet of 14.8 million flex-fuel automobiles and light trucks and 1.5 million flex-fuel motorcycles that regularly use neat ethanol fuel known as e100
bioethanol is a form of quasi-renewable energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks it can be made from very common crops such as sugarcane potato cassava and corn there has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol is in replacing gasoline concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production especially from corn recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns
cellulosic ethanol offers promise because cellulose fibers a major and universal component in plant cells walls can be used to produce ethanol according to the international energy agency cellulosic ethanol could allow ethanol fuels to play a much bigger role in the future


during ethanol fermentation glucose and other sugars in the corn or sugarcane or other crops are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide
ethanol fermentation is not 100% selective with other side products such as acetic acid glycols and many other products produced they are mostly removed during ethanol purification fermentation takes place in an aqueous solution the resulting solution has an ethanol content of around 15% ethanol is subsequently isolated and purified by a combination of adsorption and distillation
during combustion ethanol reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide water and heat:
starch and cellulose molecules are strings of glucose molecules it is also possible to generate ethanol out of cellulosic materials that however requires a pretreatment that splits the cellulose into glycose molecules and other sugars that subsequently can be fermented the resulting product is called cellulosic ethanol indicating its source
ethanol may also be produced industrially from ethylene by hydration of the double bond in the presence of catalysts and high temperature
by far the largest fraction of the global ethanol production however is produced by fermentation
ethanol is a quasi-renewable energy source because while the energy is partially generated by using a resource sunlight which cannot be depleted the harvesting process requires vast amounts of energy that typically comes from non-renewable sources creation of ethanol starts with photosynthesis causing a feedstock such as sugar cane or a grain such as maize corn to grow these feedstocks are processed into ethanol
about 5% of the ethanol produced in the world in 2003 was actually a petroleum product it is made by the catalytic hydration of ethylene with sulfuric acid as the catalyst it can also be obtained via ethylene or acetylene from calcium carbide coal oil gas and other sources two million tons of petroleum-derived ethanol are produced annually the principal suppliers are plants in the united states europe and south africa petroleum derived ethanol synthetic ethanol is chemically identical to bio-ethanol and can be differentiated only by radiocarbon dating
bio-ethanol is usually obtained from the conversion of carbon-based feedstock agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable because they get energy from the sun using photosynthesis provided that all minerals required for growth such as nitrogen and phosphorus are returned to the land ethanol can be produced from a variety of feedstocks such as sugar cane bagasse miscanthus sugar beet sorghum grain switchgrass barley hemp kenaf potatoes sweet potatoes cassava sunflower fruit molasses corn stover grain wheat straw cotton other biomass as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting whichever has the best well-to-wheel assessment
an alternative process to produce bio-ethanol from algae is being developed by the company algenol rather than grow algae and then harvest and ferment it the algae grow in sunlight and produce ethanol directly which is removed without killing the algae it is claimed the process can produce 6,000 us gallons per acre 56,000 litres per ha per year compared with 400 us gallons per acre 3,750 l ha for corn production
currently the first generation processes for the production of ethanol from corn use only a small part of the corn plant: the corn kernels are taken from the corn plant and only the starch which represents about 50% of the dry kernel mass is transformed into ethanol two types of second generation processes are under development the first type uses enzymes and yeast fermentation to convert the plant cellulose into ethanol while the second type uses pyrolysis to convert the whole plant to either a liquid bio-oil or a syngas second generation processes can also be used with plants such as grasses wood or agricultural waste material such as straw
the basic steps for large-scale production of ethanol are: microbial yeast fermentation of sugars distillation dehydration requirements vary see ethanol fuel mixtures below and denaturing optional prior to fermentation some crops require saccharification or hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch into sugars saccharification of cellulose is called cellulolysis see cellulosic ethanol enzymes are used to convert starch into sugar
ethanol is produced by microbial fermentation of the sugar microbial fermentation currently only works directly with sugars two major components of plants starch and cellulose are both made of sugars—and can in principle be converted to sugars for fermentation currently only the sugar eg sugar cane and starch eg corn portions can be economically converted there is much activity in the area of cellulosic ethanol where the cellulose part of a plant is broken down to sugars and subsequently converted to ethanol
for the ethanol to be usable as a fuel the majority of the water must be removed most of the water is removed by distillation but the purity is limited to 95–96% due to the formation of a low-boiling water-ethanol azeotrope with maximum 95.6% m m 96.5% v v ethanol and 4.4% m m 3.5% v v water this mixture is called hydrous ethanol and can be used as a fuel alone but unlike anhydrous ethanol hydrous ethanol is not miscible in all ratios with gasoline so the water fraction is typically removed in further treatment to burn in combination with gasoline in gasoline engines
there are basically three dehydration processes to remove the water from an azeotropic ethanol water mixture the first process used in many early fuel ethanol plants is called azeotropic distillation and consists of adding benzene or cyclohexane to the mixture when these components are added to the mixture it forms a heterogeneous azeotropic mixture in vapor–liquid-liquid equilibrium which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom and a vapor mixture of water ethanol and cyclohexane benzene
when condensed this becomes a two-phase liquid mixture the heavier phase poor in the entrainer benzene or cyclohexane is stripped of the entrainer and recycled to the feed—while the lighter phase with condensate from the stripping is recycled to the second column another early method called extractive distillation consists of adding a ternary component that increases ethanol's relative volatility when the ternary mixture is distilled it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column
with increasing attention being paid to saving energy many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration of these methods a third method has emerged and has been adopted by the majority of modern ethanol plants this new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol in this process ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads the bead's pores are sized to allow absorption of water while excluding ethanol after a period of time the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere eg n2 to remove the absorbed water two beds are often used so that one is available to absorb water while the other is being regenerated this dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus gallon 840 kj l compared to earlier azeotropic distillation
ethanol is hygroscopic meaning it absorbs water vapor directly from the atmosphere because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends which causes engine stall containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed this high miscibility with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons over long distances mechanics also have seen increased cases of damage to small engines in particular the carburetor attributable to the increased water retention by ethanol in fuel
the fraction of water that an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without phase separation increases with the percentage of ethanol this shows for example that e30 can have up to about 2% water if there is more than about 71% ethanol the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and phase separation does not occur the fuel mileage declines with increased water content the increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits e30 and hydrated ethanol to be put in the same tank since any combination of them always results in a single phase somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures for e10 it is about 0.5% v v at 70 f and decreases to about 0.23% v v at −30 f
while biodiesel production systems have been marketed to home and business users for many years commercialized ethanol production systems designed for end-consumer use have lagged in the marketplace in 2008 two different companies announced home-scale ethanol production systems the afs125 advanced fuel system from allard research and development is capable of producing both ethanol and biodiesel in one machine while the e-100 microfueler from e-fuel corporation is dedicated to ethanol only
ethanol most commonly powers otto cycle internal combustion engines most often on cars however it may be used to power vehicles using a diesel cycle such as buses and farm tractors ethanol has been tested for use as aviation fuel but it is not commercialised 
ethanol contains approx 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline and therefore in theory burning pure ethanol in a vehicle reduces miles per us gallon 34% given the same fuel economy compared to burning pure gasoline however since ethanol has a higher octane rating the engine can be made more efficient by raising its compression ratio using a variable turbocharger the compression ratio can be optimized for the fuel making fuel economy almost constant for any blend
for e10 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline the effect is small ~3% when compared to conventional gasoline and even smaller 1–2% when compared to oxygenated and reformulated blends for e85 85% ethanol the effect becomes significant e85 produces lower mileage than gasoline and requires more frequent refueling actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle based on epa tests for all 2006 e85 models the average fuel economy for e85 vehicles resulted 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline the epa-rated mileage of current united states flex-fuel vehicles should be considered when making price comparisons but e85 is a high performance fuel with an octane rating of about 94–96 and should be compared to premium
high ethanol blends present a problem to achieve enough vapor pressure for the fuel to evaporate and spark the ignition during cold weather since ethanol tends to increase fuel enthalpy of vaporization when vapor pressure is below 45 kpa starting a cold engine becomes difficult to avoid this problem at temperatures below 11 °c 52 °f and to reduce ethanol higher emissions during cold weather both the us and the european markets adopted e85 as the maximum blend to be used in their flexible fuel vehicles and they are optimized to run at such a blend at places with harsh cold weather the ethanol blend in the us has a seasonal reduction to e70 for these very cold regions though it is still sold as e85 at places where temperatures fall below −12 °c 10 °f during the winter it is recommended to install an engine heater system both for gasoline and e85 vehicles sweden has a similar seasonal reduction but the ethanol content in the blend is reduced to e75 during the winter months
brazilian flex fuel vehicles can operate with ethanol mixtures up to e100 which is hydrous ethanol with up to 4% water which causes vapor pressure to drop faster as compared to e85 vehicles as a result brazilian flex vehicles are built with a small secondary gasoline reservoir located near the engine during a cold start pure gasoline is injected to avoid starting problems at low temperatures this provision is particularly necessary for users of brazil's southern and central regions where temperatures normally drop below 15 °c 59 °f during the winter an improved flex engine generation was launched in 2009 that eliminates the need for the secondary gas storage tank in march 2009 volkswagen do brasil launched the polo e-flex the first brazilian flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start
in many countries cars are mandated to run on mixtures of ethanol all brazilian light-duty vehicles are built to operate for an ethanol blend of up to 25% e25 and since 1993 a federal law requires mixtures between 22% and 25% ethanol with 25% required as of mid july 2011 in the united states all light-duty vehicles are built to operate normally with an ethanol blend of 10% e10 at the end of 2010 over 90 percent of all gasoline sold in the us was blended with ethanol in january 2011 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a waiver to authorize up to 15% of ethanol blended with gasoline e15 to be sold only for cars and light pickup trucks with a model year of 2001 or newer other countries have adopted their own requirements
beginning with the model year 1999 an increasing number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification many cars and light trucks a class containing minivans suvs and pickup trucks are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% e85 in north america and europe and up to 100% e100 in brazil in older model years their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix in newer models the alcohol sensors have been removed with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content the engine control computer can also adjust advance the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned this method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect pre-ignition and detonation
whether ethanol causes unacceptable levels of corrosion in internal combustion engines has been a cause of some debate in general e10 blends see above section pose no problems at higher blends ethanol's different chemistry from oil derivates makes it corrosive for certain engine parts these are replaced to create the flex-fuel vehicles that accept up to e85
since 1989 there have also been ethanol engines based on the diesel principle operating in sweden they are used primarily in city buses but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors the engines made by scania have a modified compression ratio and the fuel known as ed95 used is a mix of 93.6% ethanol and 3.6% ignition improver and 2.8% denaturants the ignition improver makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel combustion cycle it is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol these engines have been used in the united kingdom by reading transport but the use of bioethanol fuel is now being phased out
a 2004 mit study and an earlier paper published by the society of automotive engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline the method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric the improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol or the azeotrope or e85 and gasoline in any ratio up to 100% of either in a turbocharged high compression-ratio small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement each fuel is carried separately with a much smaller tank for alcohol the high-compression for higher efficiency engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced only when necessary to suppress ‘knock’ such as when significantly accelerating direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130 the calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and co2 emission is 30% the consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid the problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline causing phase separation supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided
in a 2008 study complex engine controls and increased exhaust gas recirculation allowed a compression ratio of 19.5 with fuels ranging from neat ethanol to e50 thermal efficiency up to approximately that for a diesel was achieved this would result in the fuel economy of a neat ethanol vehicle to be about the same as one burning gasoline
the world's top ethanol fuel producers in 2011 were the united states with 13.9 billion us liquid gallons bg 52.6 billion liters and brazil with 5.6 bg 21.1 billion liters accounting together for 87.1% of world production of 22.36 billion us gallons 84.6 billion liters strong incentives coupled with other industry development initiatives are giving rise to fledgling ethanol industries in countries such as germany spain france sweden china thailand canada colombia india australia and some central american countries

all biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown collected dried fermented distilled and burned all of these steps require resources and an infrastructure the total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance or energy returned on energy invested figures compiled in a 2007 by national geographic magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the us: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol the energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in brazil is more favorable with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol energy balance estimates are not easily produced thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory for instance a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane which requires a tropical climate to grow productively returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended as compared to corn which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended a 2006 university of california berkeley study after analyzing six separate studies concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline
carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas is emitted during fermentation and combustion this is canceled out by the greater uptake of carbon dioxide by the plants as they grow to produce the biomass when compared to gasoline depending on the production method ethanol releases less greenhouse gases
compared with conventional unleaded gasoline ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide carbon monoxide water and aldehydes the clean air act requires the addition of oxygenates to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the united states the additive mtbe is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient fertilizers such as ammonia
a study by atmospheric scientists at stanford university found that e85 fuel would increase the risk of air pollution deaths relative to gasoline by 9% in los angeles us: a very large urban car-based metropolis that is a worst-case scenario ozone levels are significantly increased thereby increasing photochemical smog and aggravating medical problems such as asthma
brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel gas chromatograph studies were performed of ambient air in são paulo brazil and compared to osaka japan which does not burn ethanol fuel atmospheric formaldehyde was 160% higher in brazil and acetaldehyde was 260% higher
in 2002 monitoring the process of ethanol production from corn revealed that they released vocs volatile organic compounds at a higher rate than had previously been disclosed the us environmental protection agency epa subsequently reached settlement with archer daniels midland and cargill two of the largest producers of ethanol to reduce emission of these vocs vocs are produced when fermented corn mash is dried for sale as a supplement for livestock feed devices known as thermal oxidizers or catalytic oxidizers can be attached to the plants to burn off the hazardous gases
the calculation of exactly how much carbon dioxide is produced in the manufacture of bioethanol is a complex and inexact process and is highly dependent on the method by which the ethanol is produced and the assumptions made in the calculation a calculation should include:
such a calculation may or may not consider the following effects:

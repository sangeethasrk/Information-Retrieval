nuclear transmutation - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
nuclear transmutation is the conversion of one chemical element or an isotope into another because any element isotope is defined by its number of protons and neutrons in its atoms ie in the atomic nucleus nuclear transmutation occurs in any process where this number is changed
a transmutation can be achieved either by nuclear reactions in which an outside particle reacts with a nucleus or by radioactive decay where no outside particle is needed


although all transmutation is caused by either decay or nuclear reaction not all of these processes cause transmutation eg gamma decay internal conversion do not transmute the affected atom
natural transmutation by stellar nucleosynthesis in the past created most of the heavier chemical elements in the universe see the corresponding section below
one type of natural transmutation observable in the present occurs when certain radioactive elements present in nature spontaneously decay by a process that causes transmutation such as alpha or beta decay an example is the natural decay of potassium-40 to argon-40 which forms most of the argon in air also on earth natural transmutations from the different mechanism of natural nuclear reactions occur due to cosmic ray bombardment of elements for example to form carbon-14 and also occasionally from natural neutron bombardment for example see natural nuclear fission reactor
artificial transmutation may occur in machinery that has enough energy to cause changes in the nuclear structure of the elements such machines include particle accelerators and tokamak reactors conventional fission power reactors also cause artificial transmutation not from the power of the machine but by exposing elements to neutrons produced by a fission from an artificially produced nuclear chain reaction
artificial nuclear transmutation has been considered as a possible mechanism for reducing the volume and hazard of radioactive waste
the term transmutation dates back to alchemy alchemists pursued the philosopher's stone capable of chrysopoeia – the transformation of base metals into gold while alchemists often understood chrysopoeia as a metaphor for a mystical or religious process some practitioners adopted a literal interpretation and tried to make gold through physical experiment the impossibility of the metallic transmutation had been debated amongst alchemists philosophers and scientists since the middle ages pseudo-alchemical transmutation was outlawed and publicly mocked beginning in the fourteenth century alchemists like michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote tracts exposing fraudulent claims of gold making by the 1720s there were no longer any respectable figures pursuing the physical transmutation of substances into gold antoine lavoisier in the 18th century replaced the alchemical theory of elements with the modern theory of chemical elements and john dalton further developed the notion of atoms from the alchemical theory of corpuscles to explain various chemical processes the disintegration of atoms is a distinct process involving much greater energies than could be achieved by alchemists
it was first consciously applied to modern physics by frederick soddy when he along with ernest rutherford discovered that radioactive thorium was converting itself into radium in 1901 at the moment of realization soddy later recalled he shouted out: rutherford this is transmutation rutherford snapped back for christ's sake soddy don't call it transmutation they'll have our heads off as alchemists
rutherford and soddy were observing natural transmutation as a part of radioactive decay of the alpha decay type however in 1919 rutherford was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen using alpha particles directed at nitrogen n + α → o + p  this was the first observation of a nuclear reaction that is a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus eventually in 1932 a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by rutherford's colleagues john cockcroft and ernest walton who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7 to split the nucleus into two alpha particles the feat was popularly known as splitting the atom although it was not the modern nuclear fission reaction discovered in 1938 by otto hahn lise meitner and their assistant fritz strassmann in heavy elements
later in the twentieth century the transmutation of elements within stars was elaborated accounting for the relative abundance of heavier elements in the universe save for the first five elements which were produced in the big bang and other cosmic ray processes stellar nucleosynthesis accounted for the abundance of all elements heavier than boron in their 1957 paper synthesis of the elements in stars william alfred fowler margaret burbidge geoffrey burbidge and fred hoyle explained how the abundances of essentially all but the lightest chemical elements could be explained by the process of nucleosynthesis in stars
it transpired that under true nuclear transmutation it is far easier to turn gold into lead than the reverse reaction which was the one the alchemists had ardently pursued nuclear experiments have successfully transmuted lead into gold but the expense far exceeds any gain it would be easier to convert gold into lead via neutron capture and beta decay by leaving gold in a nuclear reactor for a long period of time
glenn seaborg produced several thousand atoms of gold from bismuth but at a net loss

the big bang is thought to be the origin of the hydrogen including all deuterium and helium in the universe hydrogen and helium together account for 98% of the mass of ordinary matter in the universe the big bang also produced small amounts of lithium beryllium and perhaps boron more lithium beryllium and boron were produced later in a natural nuclear reaction cosmic ray spallation
stellar nucleosynthesis is responsible for all of the other elements occurring naturally in the universe as stable isotopes and primordial nuclide from carbon to plutonium these occurred after the big bang during star formation some lighter elements from carbon to iron were formed in stars and released into space by asymptotic giant branch agb stars these are a type of red giant that puffs off its outer atmosphere containing some elements from carbon to nickel and iron all elements with atomic weight greater than 64 atomic mass units are produced in supernova stars by means of nuclear reaction of lighter nuclei called neutron capture which sub-divides into two processes: r-process and s-process
the solar system is thought to have condensed approximately 4.6 billion years before the present from a cloud of hydrogen and helium containing heavier elements in dust grains formed previously by a large number of such stars these grains contained the heavier elements formed by transmutation earlier in the history of the universe
all of these natural processes of transmutation in stars are continuing today in our own galaxy and in others for example the observed light curves of supernova stars such as sn 1987a show them blasting large amounts comparable to the mass of earth of radioactive nickel and cobalt into space however little of this material reaches earth most natural transmutation on the earth today is mediated by cosmic rays such as production of carbon-14 and by the radioactive decay of radioactive primordial nuclides left over from the initial formation of the solar system such as potassium-40 uranium and thorium plus the radioactive decay of products of these nucleides radium radon polonium etc see decay chain

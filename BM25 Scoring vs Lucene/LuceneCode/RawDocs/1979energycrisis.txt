1979 energy crisis - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the 1979 or second oil crisis or oil shock occurred in the united states due to decreased oil output in the wake of the iranian revolution despite the fact that global oil supply decreased by only ~4% widespread panic resulted driving the price far higher than justified by supply the price of crude oil more than doubled to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months and long lines once again appeared at gas stations as they had in the 1973 oil crisis
in 1980 following the outbreak of the iran–iraq war oil production in iran nearly stopped and iraq's oil production was severely cut as well economic recessions were triggered in the us and other countries oil prices did not subside to pre-crisis levels until the mid-1980s
after 1980 oil prices began a 20-year decline eventually reaching a 60 percent fall-off during the 1990s as with the 1973 crisis global politics and power balance were impacted oil exporters such as mexico nigeria and venezuela expanded production the ussr became the top world producer north sea and alaskan oil flooded the market and opec lost influence


amid massive protests the shah of iran mohammad reza pahlavi fled his country in early 1979 and the ayatollah khomeini soon became the new leader of iran protests severely disrupted the iranian oil sector with production being greatly curtailed and exports suspended in november 1978 a strike by 37,000 workers at iran's nationalized oil refineries initially reduced production from 6 million barrels 950,000 m per day to about 1.5 million barrels 240,000 m foreign workers including skilled oil workers fled the country on january 16 1979 the shah and his wife left iran at the behest of prime minister shapour bakhtiar a longtime opposition leader himself who sought to calm the situation
the rise in oil price benefited other opec members which made record profits when oil exports were later resumed under the new iranian government they were inconsistent and at a lower volume pushing prices up saudi arabia and other opec nations under the presidency of mana al otaiba increased production to offset most of the decline and in early 1979 the overall loss in worldwide production was about 4 percent
opec failed to hold on to its preeminent position especially after iran and iraq went to war in 1980 and caused a further 10% drop in worldwide production – and by 1981 opec production was surpassed by other exporters additionally its own member nations were divided among themselves saudi arabia a swing producer trying to gain back market share after 1985 increased production and caused downward pressure on prices making high-cost oil production facilities less profitable or even unprofitable
the oil crisis had mixed effects in the united states due to some parts of the country being oil-producing regions and other parts being oil-consuming regions richard nixon had imposed price controls on domestic oil gasoline controls were repealed but controls on domestic us oil remained
the jimmy carter administration began a phased deregulation of oil prices on april 5 1979 when the average price of crude oil was us$15.85 per barrel 42 us gallons 160 l starting with the iranian revolution the price of crude oil rose to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months its all-time highest real price until march 3 2008 deregulating domestic oil price controls allowed us oil output to rise sharply from the large prudhoe bay fields while oil imports fell sharply
and although not directly related the near-disaster at three mile island on march 28 1979 also increased anxiety about energy policy and availability
due to memories of oil shortage in 1973 motorists soon began panic buying and long lines appeared at gas stations as they had six years earlier during the 1973 oil crisis
as the average vehicle of the time consumed between two to three liters about 0.5-0.8 gallons of gasoline petrol an hour while idling it was estimated that americans wasted up to 150,000 barrels 24,000 m of oil per day idling their engines in the lines at gas stations
during the period many people believed the oil companies artificially created oil shortages to drive up prices rather than factors beyond human control or the us' own price controls the amount of oil sold in the united states in 1979 was only 3.5 percent less than the record set for oil sold the year previously a telephone poll of 1,600 american adults conducted by the associated press and nbc news and released in early may 1979 found that only 37% of americans thought the energy shortages were real 9% were not sure and 54% thought the energy shortages were a hoax
many politicians proposed gas rationing one such proponent was harry hughes governor of maryland who proposed odd-even rationing only people with an odd-numbered license plate could purchase gas on an odd-numbered day as was used during the 1973 oil crisis several states actually implemented odd-even gas rationing including california pennsylvania new york new jersey oregon and texas coupons for gasoline rationing were printed but were never actually used during the 1979 crisis
on july 15 1979 president carter outlined his plans to reduce oil imports and improve energy efficiency in his crisis of confidence speech sometimes known as the malaise speech it is often said that during the speech carter wore a cardigan he actually wore a blue suit and encouraged citizens to do what they could to reduce their use of energy he had already installed solar hot water panels on the roof of the white house and a wood-burning stove in the living quarters however the panels were removed in 1986 reportedly for roof maintenance during the administration of his successor ronald reagan
carter's speech argued the oil crisis was the moral equivalent of war critics then and now argued that his varied proposals would make the situation worse not better several months later in january 1980 carter issued the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with us oil interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on the vital interests of the united states additionally as part of his administration's efforts at deregulation carter proposed removing price controls that had been imposed by the administration of richard nixon before the 1973 crisis carter agreed to remove price controls in phases they were finally dismantled in 1981 under reagan carter also said he would impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies while the regulated price of domestic oil was kept to $6 a barrel the world market price was $30
in 1980 the us government established the synthetic fuels corporation to produce an alternative to imported fossil fuels
when the price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased 250 percent between 1978 and 1980 the oil-producing areas of texas oklahoma louisiana colorado wyoming and alaska began experiencing an economic boom and population inflows
in response to the high oil prices of the 1970s industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on opec oil electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal natural gas or nuclear power national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil and commercial exploration developed major non-opec oilfields in siberia alaska north sea and gulf of mexico by 1986 daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels non-opec production rose by an even-larger amount and opec's market share sank from 50% in 1979 to just 29% in 1985

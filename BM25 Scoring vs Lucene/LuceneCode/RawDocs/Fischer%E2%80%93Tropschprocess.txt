fischer–tropsch process - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the fischer–tropsch process is a collection of chemical reactions that converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons it was first developed by franz fischer and hans tropsch at the kaiser-wilhelm-institut für kohlenforschung in mülheim an der ruhr germany in 1925 the process a key component of gas to liquids technology produces a synthetic lubrication oil and synthetic fuel typically from coal natural gas or biomass the fischer–tropsch process has received intermittent attention as a source of low-sulfur diesel fuel and to address the supply or cost of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons a fischer–tropsch-type process has also been suggested to have produced a few of the building blocks of dna and rna within asteroids


the fischer–tropsch process involves a series of chemical reactions that produce a variety of hydrocarbons ideally having the formula cnh2n+2 the more useful reactions produce alkanes as follows:
where n is typically 10-20 the formation of methane n = 1 is unwanted most of the alkanes produced tend to be straight-chain suitable as diesel fuel in addition to alkane formation competing reactions give small amounts of alkenes as well as alcohols and other oxygenated hydrocarbons
converting a mixture of h2 and co into aliphatic products obviously should be a multi-step reaction with several sorts of intermediates the growth of the hydrocarbon chain may be visualized as involving a repeated sequence in which hydrogen atoms are added to carbon and oxygen the c o-bond is split and a new c c-bond is formed for one ch2-group produced co + 2h2 → ch2 + h2o several reactions are necessary:
the conversion of co to alkanes involves hydrogenation of co the hydrogenolysis cleavage with h2 of c-o bonds and the formation of c-c bonds such reactions are assumed to proceed via initial formation of surface-bound metal carbonyls the co ligand is speculated to undergo dissociation possibly into oxide and carbide ligands other potential intermediates are various c-1 fragments including formyl cho hydroxycarbene hcoh hydroxymethyl ch2oh methyl ch3 methylene ch2 methylidyne ch and hydroxymethylidyne coh furthermore and critical to the production of liquid fuels are reactions that form c-c bonds such as migratory insertion many related stoichiometric reactions have been simulated on discrete metal clusters but homogeneous fischer–tropsch catalysts are poorly developed and of no commercial importance
addition of isotopically labelled alcohol to the feed stream results in incorporation of alcohols into product this observation establishes the facility of c-o bond scission using c-labelled ethylene and propene over cobalt catalysts results in incorporation of these olefins into the growing chain chain growth reaction thus appears to involve both ‘olefin insertion’ as well as ‘co-insertion’
fischer–tropsch plants associated with coal or related solid feedstocks sources of carbon must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants ie co h2 and alkanes this conversion is called gasification and the product is called synthesis gas syn gas synthesis gas obtained from coal gasification tends to have a h2 co ratio of ~0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of ~2 this ratio is adjusted via the water-gas shift reaction coal-based fischer–tropsch plants produce varying amounts of co2 depending upon the energy source of the gasification process however most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the fischer–tropsch process
carbon monoxide for ft catalysis is derived from hydrocarbons in gas to liquids gtl technology the hydrocarbons are low molecular weight materials that often would be discarded or flared stranded gas provides relatively cheap gas gtl is viable provided gas remains relatively cheaper than oil
several reactions are required to obtain the gaseous reactants required for fischer–tropsch catalysis first reactant gases entering a fischer–tropsch reactor must be desulfurized otherwise sulfur-containing impurities deactivate poison the catalysts required for fischer–tropsch reactions
several reactions are employed to adjust the h2 co ratio most important is the water gas shift reaction which provides a source of hydrogen at the expense of carbon monoxide:
for fischer–tropsch plants that use methane as the feedstock another important reaction is steam reforming which converts the methane into co and h2:
generally the fischer–tropsch process is operated in the temperature range of 150–300 °c 302–572 °f higher temperatures lead to faster reactions and higher conversion rates but also tend to favor methane production for this reason the temperature is usually maintained at the low to middle part of the range increasing the pressure leads to higher conversion rates and also favors formation of long-chained alkanes both of which are desirable typical pressures range from one to several tens of atmospheres even higher pressures would be favorable but the benefits may not justify the additional costs of high-pressure equipment and higher pressures can lead to catalyst deactivation via coke formation
a variety of synthesis-gas compositions can be used for cobalt-based catalysts the optimal h2:co ratio is around 1.8–2.1 iron-based catalysts promote the water-gas-shift reaction and thus can tolerate lower ratios this reactivity can be important for synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass which tend to have relatively low h2:co ratios <1
efficient removal of heat from the reactor is the basic need of the fischer-tropsch reactors since these reactions are characterized by high exothermicity four types of reactors are discussed:
multi tubular fixed bed reactor: this type of reactor contains number of tubes with small diameter these tubes contains catalyst and are surrounded by boiling water which removes the heat of reaction fixed bed reactor is suitable to operate at low temperatures and has upper temperature limit of 530 k excess temperature leads to carbon deposition and hence blockage of the reactor since large amounts of products formed are in liquid state this type of reactor can also be termed as trickle flow reactor system
entrained flow reactor: an important requirement of the reactor for the fischer–tropsch process is to remove the heat of the reaction this type of reactor contains two banks of heat exchangers which remove heat the remainder of which is removed by products and recycled in the system the formation of heavy waxes should be avoided since they condense on the catalyst and form agglomeration this leads to fluidization hence risers are operated over 570 k
slurry reactors: heat removal is done by internal cooling coils synthesis gas is bubbled through the waxy products and finely divided catalyst which is suspended in the liquid medium this also provides agitation of the contents of the reactor catalyst particle size reduces diffusional heat and mass transfer limitations lower temperature in the reactor leads to more viscous product and higher > 570 k gives undesirable products spectrum however separation of the product from the catalyst is a problem
fluid-bed- and circulating catalystriser reactors: these are used for high temperature fischer tropsch synthesis nearly 340 °c to produce low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbons on alkalised fused iron catalysts the fluid bed technology as adapted from catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates was introduced by hydrocarbon research in the years 1946–1950 and named the ‘hydrocol’ process a large scale fischer-tropsch hydrocol plant 350,000 tons per annum operated during the years 1951–1957 in brownsville texas due to technical problems and lacking economy at increasing petroleum availability this development was discontinued fluid bed fischer-tropsch synthesis has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by sasol one reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built nearly 850,000 tons per annum the process is now used for mainly olefins c2 c7 production this new development can be regarded as an important progress in fischer tropsch technology a high temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst ‘circulating fluid bed’ ‘riser reactor’ ‘entrained catalyst process’ was introduced by the kellogg company and a respective plant built at sasol in 1956 it was improved by sasol for successful operation at secunda south africa sasol has operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior sasol advanced fluid bed technology early experiments with cobalt-catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by fischer the bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a co-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by kölbel at the rheinpreuben company in 1953 recently since 1990 low-temperature fischer-tropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax to be used as such or to be hydrocracked and isomerised to mainly diesel fuel by exxon and sasol today slurry phase bubble column low temperature fischer-tropsch synthesis is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for fischer-tropsch clean diesel production this fischer-tropsch technology is also under development by the statoil company norway for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid
in general the product distribution of hydrocarbons formed during the fischer–tropsch process follows an anderson–schulz–flory distribution which can be expressed as:
where wn is the weight fraction of hydrocarbons containing n carbon atoms α is the chain growth probability or the probability that a molecule will continue reacting to form a longer chain in general α is largely determined by the catalyst and the specific process conditions
examination of the above equation reveals that methane will always be the largest single product so long as alpha is less than 0.5 however by increasing α close to one the total amount of methane formed can be minimized compared to the sum of all of the various long-chained products increasing α increases the formation of long-chained hydrocarbons the very long-chained hydrocarbons are waxes which are solid at room temperature therefore for production of liquid transportation fuels it may be necessary to crack some of the fischer–tropsch products in order to avoid this some researchers have proposed using zeolites or other catalyst substrates with fixed sized pores that can restrict the formation of hydrocarbons longer than some characteristic size usually n<10 this way they can drive the reaction so as to minimize methane formation without producing lots of long-chained hydrocarbons such efforts have met with only limited success
a variety of catalysts can be used for the fischer–tropsch process but the most common are the transition metals cobalt iron and ruthenium nickel can also be used but tends to favor methane formation “methanation”
cobalt-based catalysts are highly active although iron may be more suitable for certain applications cobalt catalysts are more active for fischer–tropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass synthesis gases derived from these hydrogen-poor feedstocks has a low-hydrogen-content and require the water-gas-shift reaction unlike the other metals used for this process co ni ru which remain in the metallic state during synthesis iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases including various oxides and carbides during the reaction control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles
in addition to the active metal the catalysts typically contain a number of promoters including potassium and copper group 1 alkali metals including potassium are a poison for cobalt catalysts but are promoters for iron catalysts catalysts are supported on high-surface-area binders supports such as silica alumina or zeolites promotors also have an important influence on activity alkali metal oxides and copper are common promotors but the formulation depends on the primary metal iron vs cobalt alkali oxides on cobalt catalysts generally cause activity to drop severely even with very low alkali loadings c5+ and co2 selectivity increase while methane and c2-c4 selectivity decrease in addition the olefin to paraffin ratio increases
fischer–tropsch catalysts are sensitive to poisoning by sulfur-containing compounds cobalt-based catalysts are more sensitive than for their iron counterparts
fischer tropsch iron catalysts need alkali promotion to attain high activity and stability eg 0.5 wt% k 2o addition of cu for reduction promotion addition of sio 2 al 2o 3 for structural promotion and maybe some manganese can be applied for selectivity control eg high olefinicity the working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron with iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued one direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process sasol-synthol process due to the relatively high reaction temperature approx 340 °c the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions the catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small particle diameter 100 mm and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite plus promoters after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate for maximising the overall gasoline yield the olefins c3 c4 have been oligomerised at sasol however recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in eg polymerization processes is advantageous today the second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature where most of the hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions typically such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions a high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores the main product fraction then is a paraffin wax which is refined to marketable wax materials at sasol however it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel thus iron catalysts are very flexible
ruthenium is most active working at the lowest reaction temperature it produces the highest molecular weight hydrocarbons ‘polymethylene synthesis’ pichler and buffleb performing thus the chain growth reaction in the cleanest mode it acts as a fischer tropsch catalyst as the pure metal without any promotors thus providing the simplest catalytic system of fischer tropsch synthesis where mechanistic conclusions should be the easiest—eg much easier than with iron as the catalyst like with nickel the selectivity changes to mainly methane at elevated temperature its high price and limited world resources exclude industrial application systematic fischer tropsch studies with ruthenium catalysts should contribute substantially to the further exploration of the fundamentals of fischer tropsch synthesis there is an interesting question to consider: what features have the metals nickel iron cobalt and ruthenium in common to let them —and only them— be fischer tropsch catalysts converting the co h2 mixture to aliphatic long chain hydrocarbons in a ‘one step reaction’ the term ‘one step reaction’ means that reaction intermediates are not desorbed from the catalyst surface in particular it is amazing that the much carbided alkalized iron catalyst gives this reaction similarly as the just metallic ruthenium catalyst it will be seen in the next section that the kinetic principle of ‘selective inhibition’ might be the common feature which appliesin spite of differences in catalyst composition reaction intermediates steps of reaction and corresponding kinetic schemes

since the invention of the original process by fischer and tropsch working at the kaiser-wilhelm-institut for chemistry in the 1920s many refinements and adjustments were made fischer and tropsch filed a number of patents eg us patent 1,746,464 applied 1926 published 1930 it was commercialized by brabag in germany in 1936 being petroleum-poor but coal-rich germany used the fischer–tropsch process during world war ii to produce ersatz replacement fuels fischer–tropsch production accounted for an estimated 9% of german war production of fuels and 25% of the automobile fuel

the fischer–tropsch process has been applied in large-scale gas–liquids and coal–liquid facilities such as shell's pearl gtl facility in ras laffan qatar such large facilities are susceptible to high capital costs high operation and maintenance costs the uncertain and volatile price of crude oil and the involvement of potentially environmentally damaging processes in particular the use of natural gas as a feedstock becomes practical only with use of stranded gas ie sources of natural gas far from major cities which are impractical to exploit with conventional gas pipelines and lng technology otherwise the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of so-called stranded gas reserves
conventional ft reactors have been optimized for massive coal-to-liquids and gas–liquid facilities such as shell's pearl gtl facility these slurry bed and fixed-bed reactors are much larger than the sizes needed for biofuel facilities or for smaller-scale natural-gas fields the use of microchannel reactors such as those developed by velocys intensifies the reaction scales down the size of the reaction hardware and overcomes the heat and mass transport problems associated with conventional ft technology enhanced heat transfer inside the microchannels reactor allows for optimal temperature control which maximizes catalyst activity and life while no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation indications show capital costs operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional ft facilities

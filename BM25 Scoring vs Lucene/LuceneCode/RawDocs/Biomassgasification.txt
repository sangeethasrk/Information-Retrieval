gasification - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
gasification is a process that converts organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide hydrogen and carbon dioxide this is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures >700 °c without combustion with a controlled amount of oxygen and or steam the resulting gas mixture is called syngas from synthesis gas or synthetic gas or producer gas and is itself a fuel the power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas is considered to be a source of renewable energy if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass
the advantage of gasification is that using the syngas is potentially more efficient than direct combustion of the original fuel because it can be combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by carnot's rule is higher or in case of fuel cells not applicable syngas may be burned directly in gas engines used to produce methanol and hydrogen or converted via the fischer–tropsch process into synthetic fuel gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as biodegradable waste in addition the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity


the process of producing energy using the gasification method has been in use for more than 180 years during that time coal and peat were used to power these plants initially developed to produce town gas for lighting and cooking in the 1800s this was replaced by electricity and natural gas it was also used in blast furnaces but the bigger role was played in the production of synthetic chemicals where it has been in use since the 1920s
during both world wars especially the world war ii the need for fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum wood gas generators called gasogene or gazogène were used to power motor vehicles in europe by 1945 there were trucks buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification it is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world
in a gasifier the carbonaceous material undergoes several different processes:
in essence a limited amount of oxygen or air is introduced into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be burned to produce carbon dioxide and energy which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide further reactions occur when the formed carbon monoxide and residual water from the organic material react to form methane and excess carbon dioxide 4 co + 2 h2o --> ch4 + 3 co2 this third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the residence time of the reactive gases and organic materials as well as heat and pressure catalysts are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates thus moving the system closer to the reaction equilibrium for a fixed residence time
several types of gasifiers are currently available for commercial use: counter-current fixed bed co-current fixed bed fluidized bed entrained flow plasma and free radical
a fixed bed of carbonaceous fuel eg coal or biomass through which the gasification agent steam oxygen and or air flows in counter-current configuration the ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a slag the slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature the nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking so that it will form a permeable bed although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent the throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low however this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use the tar can be recycled to the reactor
in the gasification of fine undensified biomass such as rice hulls it is necessary to blow air into the reactor by means of a fan this creates very high gasification temperature as high as 1000 c above the gasification zone a bed of fine and hot char is formed and as the gas is blow forced through this bed most complex hydrocarbons are broken down into simple components of hydrogen and carbon monoxide
similar to the counter-current type but the gasification agent gas flows in co-current configuration with the fuel downwards hence the name down draft gasifier heat needs to be added to the upper part of the bed either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources the produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type
the fuel is fluidized in oxygen and steam or air the ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize the temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers so the fuel must be highly reactive low-grade coals are particularly suitable the agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures and are suitable for higher rank coals fuel throughput is higher than for the fixed bed but not as high as for the entrained flow gasifier the conversion efficiency can be rather low due to elutriation of carbonaceous material recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash
a dry pulverized solid an atomized liquid fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen much less frequent: air in co-current flow the gasification reactions take place in a dense cloud of very fine particles most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high operating temperatures and because the coal particles are well separated from one another
the high temperatures and pressures also mean that a higher throughput can be achieved however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned with existing technology the high temperatures also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers all entrained flow gasifiers remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature
a smaller fraction of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry fly ash or as a black colored fly ash slurry some fuels in particular certain types of biomasses can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall however some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag these types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags
some fuels have ashes with very high ash fusion temperatures in this case mostly limestone is mixed with the fuel prior to gasification addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures the fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifiers this means the fuel must be pulverized which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifiers by far the most energy consumption related to entrained flow gasification is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the gasification

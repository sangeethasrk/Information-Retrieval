daylighting - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
daylighting is the practice of placing windows or other openings and reflective surfaces so that during the day natural light provides effective internal lighting particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial electric lighting or from passive solar heating artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights because daylight is present or by dimming switching electric lights automatically in response to the presence of daylight a process known as daylight harvesting
daylighting is a technical term given to a common centuries-old geography and culture independent design basic when rediscovered by 20th century architects the amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation today the use of software such as radiance can allow an architect or engineer to quickly undertake complex calculations to review the benefit of a particular design
the source of all daylight is the sun the proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight solar radiation that reaches a site without being scattered within the earthâ€™s atmosphere is called direct sunlight in contrast light that is scattered in the atmosphere is referred to as diffused daylight ground reflected light also contributes to the daylight each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates there is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall north-facing wall in the northern hemisphere and south-facing wall in the southern hemisphere of a building from the autumnal equinox to the spring equinox in parts of the globe north of the tropic of cancer and in part of the globe south of the tropic of capricorn traditionally houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side but more and larger windows on the equatorial-side south-facing wall in the northern hemisphere and north-facing wall in the southern hemisphere equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year except in tropical latitudes in summertime so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows even so during mid-winter light incidence is highly directional and casts deep shadows this may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion light pipes or tubes and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces in fairly low latitudes in summertime windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator


windows are the most common way to admit daylight into a space their vertical orientation means that they selectively admit sunlight and diffuse daylight at different times of the day and year therefore windows on multiple orientations must usually be combined to produce the right mix of light for the building depending on the climate and latitude there are three ways to improve the amount of light available from a window: a placing the window close to a light colored wall b slanting the sides of window openings so the inner opening is larger than the outer opening or c using a large light colored window-sill to project light into the room
different types and grades of glass and different window treatments can also affect the amount of light transmission through the windows the type of glazing is an important issue expressed by its vt coefficient visual transmittance also known as visual light transmittance vlt as the name suggests this coefficient measures how much visible light is admitted by the window a low vt below 0.4 can reduce by half or more the light coming into a room but be also aware of high vt glass: high vt numbers say above 0.60 can be a cause of glare on the other hand you should also take into account the undesirable effects of large windows
another important element in creating daylighting is the use of clerestory windows these are high vertically placed windows they can be used to increase direct solar gain when oriented towards the equator when facing toward the sun clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable glare in the case of a passive solar house clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar-side north in the northern hemisphere south in the southern hemisphere rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated alternatively clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight from the north in the northern hemisphere that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office
often clerestory windows also shine onto interior wall surfaces painted white or another light color these walls are placed so as to reflect indirect light to interior areas where it is needed this method has the advantage of reducing the directionality of light to make it softer and more diffuse reducing shadows
skylights are light transmitting fenestration products filling openings in a building envelope which also includes windows doors etc forming all or a portion of the roof of a building space skylights are widely used in daylighting design in residential and commercial buildings mainly because they are the most effective source of daylight on a unit area basis
an alternative to a skylight is a roof lantern a roof lantern is a daylighting cupola that sits above a roof as opposed to a skylight which is fitted into a roof's construction roof lanterns serve as both an architectural feature and a method of introducing natural light into a space and are typically wooden or metal structures with a number of glazed glass panels
another roof-angled glass alternative is a sawtooth roof found on older factories sawtooth roofs have vertical roof glass facing away from the equator side of the building to capture diffused light not harsh direct equator-side solar gain the angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier the sawtooth roof's lighting concept partially reduces the summer solar furnace skylight problem but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior roof glass in the cold winter with significant undesirable heat transfer
atrium is a large open space located within buildings it is often used to light a central circulation or public area by daylight admitted through a glass roof or wall atrium provides some daylight to adjacent working areas but the amount is often small and does not penetrate very far the main function of an atrium is to provide a visual experience and a degree of contact with the outside for people in the working areas the daylighting of successive storeys of rooms adjoining an atrium is interdependent and requires a balanced approach light from the sky can easily penetrate the upper storeys but not the lower which rely primarily on light reflected from internal surfaces of the atrium such as floor-reflected light the upper stories need less window area than the lower ones and if the atrium walls are light in color the upper walls will reflect light toward the lower stories
it is possible to provide some daylight into spaces that have low possibility of windows or skylights through remote distribution devices such as light tube remote daylight distribution systems could be inherently inefficient and the further they have to transmit the daylight and the more convoluted the path the greater is the inefficiency the efficiency of many remote distribution systems can also vary dramatically from clear to overcast skies nonetheless where there is no other possibility of providing daylight to a space remote distribution systems can be appreciated
once used extensively in office buildings the manually adjustable light reflector is seldom in use today having been supplanted by a combination of other methods in concert with artificial illumination the reflector had found favor where the choices of artificial light provided poor illumination compared to modern electric lighting
light shelves are an effective way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal light shelf outside the window usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave the light shelf projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to illuminate the ceiling this reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows reducing the need for general illumination
in the cold winter a natural light shelf is created when there is snow on the ground which makes it reflective low winter sun see sun path reflects off the snow and increases solar gain through equator-facing glass by one- to two-thirds which brightly lights the ceiling of these rooms glare control drapes may be required
another type of device used is the light tube also called a tubular daylighting device tdd which is placed into a roof and admits light to a focused area of the interior these somewhat resemble recessed ceiling light fixtures they do not allow as much heat transfer as skylights because they have less surface area
tdds use modern technology to transmit visible light through opaque walls and roofs the tube itself is a passive component consisting of either a simple reflective interior coating or a light conducting fiber optic bundle it is frequently capped with a transparent roof-mounted dome light collector and terminated with a diffuser assembly that admits the daylight into interior spaces and distributes the available light energy evenly or else efficiently if the use of the lit space is reasonably fixed and the user desired one or more bright-spots
the tubular daylighting device was invented by solatube international in 1993 and is used to provide daylighting to residential and commercial buildings contributing to sustainability from a lighting standpoint and reducing the carbon footprint
another way to make a secure structural concrete wall translucent is to embed optical fiber cables in it daylight and shadow images can then pass directly through a thick solid-concrete wall
smart glass is the name given to a class of materials and devices that can be switched between a transparent state and a state which is opaque translucent reflective or retro-reflective the switching is done by applying a voltage to the material or by performing some simple mechanical operation windows skylights etc that are made of smart glass can be used to adjust indoor lighting compensating for changes of the brightness of the light outdoors and of the required brightness indoors
the use of heliostats mirrors which are moved automatically to reflect sunlight in a constant direction as the sun moves across the sky is gaining popularity as an energy-efficient method of lighting a heliostat can be used to shine sunlight directly through a window or skylight or into any arrangement of optical elements such as light tubes that distribute the light where it is needed the image shows a mirror that rotates on a computer-controlled motor-driven altazimuth mount
solar street lights raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure the solar array of such off-grid pv system charges a rechargeable battery which powers a fluorescent or led lamp during the night solar street lights are stand-alone power systems and have the advantage of savings on trenching landscaping and maintenance costs as well as on the electric bills despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting they are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation they are expected to dim only slightly
oak ridge national laboratory ornl has developed a new alternative to skylights called hybrid solar lighting this design uses a roof-mounted light collector large-diameter optical fiber and modified efficient fluorescent lighting fixtures that have transparent rods connected to the optical fiber cables essentially no electricity is needed for daytime natural interior lighting
field tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 of the new hsl technology were promising but the low-volume equipment production is still expensive hsl should become more cost effective in the near future a version that can withstand windstorms could begin to replace conventional commercial fluorescent lighting systems with improved implementations in 2008 and beyond the us 2007 energy bill provides funding for hsl r&d and multiple large commercial buildings are ready to fund further hsl application development and deployment
at night ornl hsl uses variable-intensity fluorescent lighting electronic control ballasts as the sunlight gradually decreases at sunset the fluorescent fixture is gradually turned up to give a near-constant level of interior lighting from daylight until after it becomes dark outside
hsl may soon become an option for commercial interior lighting it can transmit about half of the direct sunlight it receives
in a well-designed isolated solar gain building with a solarium sunroom greenhouse etc there is usually significant glass on the equator side a large area of glass can also be added between the sun room and the interior living quarters low-cost high-volume-produced patio door safety glass is an inexpensive way to accomplish this goal
the doors used to enter a room should be opposite the sun room interior glass so that a user can see outside immediately when entering most rooms halls should be minimized with open spaces used instead if a hall is necessary for privacy or room isolation inexpensive patio door safety glass can be placed on both sides of the hall drapes over the interior glass can be used to control lighting drapes can optionally be automated with sensor-based electric motor controls that are aware of room occupancy daylight interior temperature and time of day passive solar buildings with no central air conditioning system need control mechanisms for hourly daily and seasonal temperature-and-daylight variations if the temperature is correct and a room is unoccupied the drapes can automatically close to reduce heat transfer in either direction
to help distribute sun room daylight to the sides of rooms that are farthest from the equator inexpensive ceiling-to-floor mirrors can be used
building codes require a second means of egress in case of fire most designers use a door on one side of bedrooms and an outside window but west-side windows provide very-poor summer thermal performance instead of a west-facing window designers use an r-13 foam-filled solid energy-efficient exterior door it may have a glass storm door on the outside so that light can pass through when the inner door is opened east west glass doors and windows should be fully shaded top-to-bottom or a spectrally selective coating can be used to reduce solar gain
architects and interior designers often use daylighting as one of design elements good daylighting requires attention to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of design
utilizing natural light is one of the design aspects in architecture in 1929 the french architect le corbusier said that the history of architectural material has been the endless struggle for light in other words the history of windows as he emphasized in his architecture such as notre dame du haut daylighting has been a major architectural design elements see mit chapel and church of the light for examples not only the aesthetic aspects the impact of daylighting on human health and work performance is also considered as qualitative daylighting the current studies show that lighting conditions in workplaces contribute to a variety of factors related to work satisfaction productivity and well-being and significantly higher visual acceptance scores under daylighting than electrical lighting studies have also shown that light has a direct effect on human health because of the way it influences the circadian rhythms

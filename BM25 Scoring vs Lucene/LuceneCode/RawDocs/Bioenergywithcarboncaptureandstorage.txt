bio-energy with carbon capture and storage - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
bio-energy with carbon capture and storage beccs is a future greenhouse gas mitigation technology which produces negative carbon dioxide emissions by combining bioenergy energy from biomass use with geologic carbon capture and storage the concept of beccs is drawn from the integration of trees and crops which extract carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere as they grow the use of this biomass in processing industries or power plants and the application of carbon capture and storage via co2 injection into geological formations there are other non-beccs forms of carbon dioxide removal and storage that include technologies such as biochar carbon dioxide air capture and biomass burial
according to a recent biorecro report there is 550 000 tonnes co2 year in total beccs capacity currently operating divided between three different facilities as of january 2012
it was pointed out in the ipcc fourth assessment report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as a key technology for reaching low carbon dioxide atmospheric concentration targets the negative emissions that can be produced by beccs has been estimated by the royal society to be equivalent to a 50 to 150 ppm decrease in global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and according to the international energy agency the blue map climate change mitigation scenario calls for more than 2 gigatonnes of negative co2 emissions per year with beccs in 2050 according to stanford university 10 gigatonnes is achievable by this date
the imperial college london the uk met office hadley centre for climate prediction and research the tyndall centre for climate change research the walker institute for climate system research and the grantham institute for climate change issued a joint report on carbon dioxide removal technologies as part of the avoid: avoiding dangerous climate change research program stating that overall of the technologies studied in this report beccs has the greatest maturity and there are no major practical barriers to its introduction into today’s energy system the presence of a primary product will support early deployment
according to the oecd achieving lower concentration targets 450 ppm depends significantly on the use of beccs


the main appeal of beccs is in its ability to result in negative emissions of co2 the capture of carbon dioxide from bioenergy sources effectively removes co2 from the atmosphere
bio-energy is derived from biomass which is a renewable energy source and serves as a carbon sink during its growth during industrial processes the biomass combusted or processed re-releases the co2 into the atmosphere the process thus results in a net zero emission of co2 though this may be positively or negatively altered depending on the carbon emissions associated with biomass growth transport and processing see below under environmental considerations carbon capture and storage ccs technology serves to intercept the release of co2 into the atmosphere and redirect it into geological storage locations co2 with a biomass origin is not only released from biomass fuelled power plants but also during the production of pulp used to make paper and in the production of biofuels such as biogas and bioethanol the beccs technology can also be employed on such industrial processes
it is argued that through the beccs technology carbon dioxide is trapped in geologic formations for very long periods of time whereas for example a tree only stores its carbon during its lifetime in its report on the ccs technology ipcc projects that more than 99% of carbon dioxide which is stored through geologic sequestration is likely to stay in place for more than 1000 years while other types of carbon sinks such as the ocean trees and soil may involve the risk of negative feedback loops at increased temperatures beccs technology is likely to provide a better permanence by storing co2 in geological formations
the amount of co2 that has been released to date is believed to be too much to be able to be absorbed by conventional sinks such as trees and soil in order to reach low emission targets in addition to the presently accumulated emissions there will be significant additional emissions during this century even in the most ambitious low-emission scenarios beccs has therefore been suggested as a technology to reverse the emission trend and create a global system of net negative emissions this implies that the emissions would not only be zero but negative so that not only the emissions but the absolute amount of co2 in the atmosphere would be reduced
the main technology for co2 capture from biotic sources generally employs the same technology as carbon dioxide capture from conventional fossil fuel sources broadly three different types of technologies exist: post-combustion pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion
however on the critical subject of upstream large-scale provision of the biomass ipcc wg3 summary for policymakers cultivation refinery technology marine based beccs ie mbecs operations within the sub-tropical convergence zones stcz offers a unique combination of stable oceanic environmental conditions which can physically accommodate vast mbecs operations while avoiding the long list of limiting factors found within terrestrial beccs the stczs are marine deserts with no practical levels of biological activity within the surface or nutricline waters and which also offers vast amounts of renewable energy for cultivation processing of the biomass
the raw nutrients found within the nutricline can be used to support vast scale biomass production with only mineral importation the cultivation of both micro and macro algal species can be augmented with terrestrial species such as halophytes for oil and bamboo for cellulosic ethanol grown through aquaponic sub-systems the use of non-photosynthesis dependent cultivation methods expands micro algal cultivation into all three dimensions farming down the water column to 50+ meters is possible also a broad spectrum of critical non-fuel commodities such as food feed fertilizer plastic and vast volumes of freshwater production can economically subsidize mbecs biofuel production at sub fossil fuel prices
based upon reasonable assumptions concerning biofuel production output for 1 km2 under the mbecs scenario the total global replacement of fossil fuels can be achieved at <1.5m km2 of mbecs operations global replacement of fossil fuels is achievable within 20 years while within that same time frame all energy importing nations can achieve energy independence through involvement in the imbecs protocol
the coordination of an internationally collaborative mbecs effort is the focus of the intergovernmental marine bio-energy and carbon sequestration imbecs protocol developed by michael hayes
the sustainable technical potential for net negative emissions with beccs has been estimated to 10 gt of co2 equivalent annually with an economic potential of up to 3.5 gt of co2 equivalent annually at a cost of less than 50 € tonne and up to 3.9 gt of co2 equivalent annually at a cost of less than 100 € tonne
based on the current kyoto protocol agreement carbon capture and storage projects are not applicable as an emission reduction tool to be used for the clean development mechanism cdm or for joint implementation ji projects recognising ccs technologies as an emission reduction tool is vital for the implementation of such plants as there is no other financial motivation for the implementation of such systems there has been growing support to have fossil ccs and beccs included in the protocol accounting studies on how this can be implemented including beccs have also been done
the largest and most detailed techno-economic assessment of beccs was carried out by cmcl innovations and the tesbic group techno-economic study of biomass to ccs in 2012 this project recommended the most promising set of biomass fuelled power generation technologies coupled with carbon capture and storage ccs the project outcomes lead to a detailed “biomass ccs roadmap” for the uk

natural resource management - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
natural resource management refers to the management of natural resources such as land water soil plants and animals with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations stewardship
natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural landscapes interact it brings together land use planning water management biodiversity conservation and the future sustainability of industries like agriculture mining tourism fisheries and forestry it recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity
natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and ecology and the life-supporting capacity of those resources environmental management is also similar to natural resource management in academic contexts the sociology of natural resources is closely related to but distinct from natural resource management


the emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of north american rangelands in the late 19th century and the resource conservation movement of the same time this type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist conservation strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources a more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social cultural economic and political aspects of resource management a more holistic national and even global form evolved from the brundtland commission and the advocacy of sustainable development
in 2005 the government of new south wales established a standard for quality natural resource management to improve the consistency of practice based on an adaptive management approach
in the united states the most active areas of natural resource management are wildlife management often associated with ecotourism and rangeland pastures management in australia water sharing such as the murray darling basin|murray darling basin plan and catchment management are also significant
natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of stakeholders natural resources:
ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources but only at the permission of the state national forest national parks and military reservations are some us examples
any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owners private land is the most common example
it is a private property of a group the group may vary in size nature and internal structure eg indigenous neighbours of village some examples of common property are community forests
there is no definite owner of these properties each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish these areas are the most exploited it is said that everybody's property is nobody’s property an example is a lake fishery common land may exist without ownership in which case in the uk it is vested in a local authority
many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes an example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in nsw australia where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation but where most native vegetation exists on private land
stakeholder analysis originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into natural resource management in ever growing popularity stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources
there is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder
different approaches to who is a stakeholder:
management
management
management
therefore it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised
billgrena and holme identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management:
this gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions there are numerous stakeholder theories such as mitchell et al however grimble created a framework of stages for a stakeholder analysis in natural resource management grimble designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management
stages in stakeholder analysis:
application:
grimble and wellard established that stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as
case studies:
in the case of the bwindi impenetrable national park a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people’s livelihoods and loss of life
nepal indonesia and koreas' community forestry are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources this allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests
criticisms:
alternatives  complementary forms of analysis:
natural resource management issues are inherently complex as they involve the ecological cycles hydrological cycles climate animals plants and geography etc all these are dynamic and inter-related a change in one of them may have far reaching and or long term impacts which may even be irreversible in addition to the natural systems natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests policies politics geographical boundaries economic implications and the list goes on it is very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time this results in conflicting situations
after the united nations conference for the environment and development unced held in rio de janeiro in 1992 most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land water and forests although program names vary from nation to nation all express similar aims
the various approaches applied to natural resource management include:
the community-based natural resource management cbnrm approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities the three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life when a local people’s quality of life is enhanced their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of subsidiarity
the united nations advocates cbnrm in the convention on biodiversity and the convention to combat desertification unless clearly defined decentralised nrm can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can eg forest communities in central kalimantan indonesia
a problem of cbnrm is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation the concept and conflicting interests of cbnrm show how the motives behind the participation are differentiated as either people-centred active or participatory results that are truly

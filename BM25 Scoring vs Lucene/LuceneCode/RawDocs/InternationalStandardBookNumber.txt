international standard book number - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the international standard book number isbn is a unique numeric commercial book identifier
an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a book for example an e-book a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different isbn the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007 and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007 the method of assigning an isbn is nation-based and varies from country to country often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country
the initial isbn configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 based upon the 9-digit standard book numbering sbn created in 1966 the 10-digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 the sbn code can be converted to a ten digit isbn by prefixing it with a zero
occasionally a book may appear without a printed isbn if it is printed privately or the author does not follow the usual isbn procedure however this can be rectified later
another identifier the international standard serial number issn identifies periodical publications such as magazines and the international standard music number ismn covers for musical scores


the standard book numbering sbn code is a numeric commercial book identifier based upon 9-digits created by gordon foster emeritus professor of statistics at trinity college dublin for the booksellers and stationers whsmith and others in 1965 the isbn configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 by david whitaker regarded as the father of the isbn and emery koltay who later became director of the us isbn agency bowker
the 10-digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 the united kingdom continued to use the 9-digit sbn code until 1974 iso has appointed the international isbn agency as the registration authority for isbn worldwide and the isbn standard is developed under the control of iso technical committee 46 subcommittee 9 tc 46 sc 9 the iso on-line facility only refers back to 1978
an sbn may be converted to an isbn by prefixing the digit 0 for example the second edition of mr j g reeder returns published by hodder in 1965 has sbn 340 01381 8 - 340 indicating the publisher 01381 their serial number and 8 being the check digit this can be converted to isbn 0-340-01381-8 the check digit does not need to be re-calculated
since 1 january 2007 isbns have contained 13 digits a format that is compatible with bookland european article number ean-13s
an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a book for example an ebook a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different isbn the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007 and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007 an international standard book number consists of 4 parts if it is a 10 digit isbn or 5 parts for a 13 digit isbn:
a 13-digit isbn can be separated into its parts prefix element registration group registrant publication and check digit and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces separating the parts registration group registrant publication and check digit of a 10-digit isbn is also done with either hyphens or spaces figuring out how to correctly separate a given isbn number is complicated because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits
isbn issuance is country-specific in that isbns are issued by the isbn registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded in canada isbns are issued at no cost with the stated purpose of encouraging canadian culture in the united kingdom united states and some other countries where the service is provided by non-government-funded organisations the issuing of isbns requires payment of a fee
australia: isbns are issued by the commercial library services agency thorpe-bowker and prices range from $42 for a single isbn plus a $55 registration fee for new publishers to $2,890 for a block of 1,000 isbns access is immediate when requested via their website
brazil: national library of brazil a government agency is responsible for issuing isbns and there is a cost of r$16
canada: library and archives canada a government agency is responsible for issuing isbns and there is no cost works in french are issued an isbn by the bibliothèque et archives nationales du québec
india: the raja rammohun roy library foundation rrrlf part of the ministry of culture is responsible for registration of indian publishers authors universities institutions and government departments that are responsible for publishing books
italy: the privately held company ediser srl owned by associazione italiana editori italian publishers association is responsible for issuing isbns the original national prefix 978-88 is reserved for publishing companies starting at €49 for a ten-codes block while a new prefix 979-12 is dedicated to self-publishing authors at a fixed price of €25 for a single code
new zealand: the national library of new zealand is responsible for isbn registrations for publishers who are publishing in new zealand
pakistan: the national library of pakistan is responsible for isbn registrations for pakistani publishers authors universities institutions and government departments that are responsible for publishing books
south africa: the national library of south africa is responsible for isbn issuance for south african publishing institutions and authors
united kingdom and republic of ireland: the privately held company nielsen book services ltd part of nielsen holdings nv is responsible for issuing isbns in blocks of 10 100 or 1000 prices start from £120 plus vat for the smallest block on a standard turnaround of ten days
united states: in the united states the privately held company rr bowker issues isbns there is a charge that varies depending upon the number of isbns purchased with prices starting at $125.00 for a single number access is immediate when requested via their website
publishers and authors in other countries obtain isbns from their respective national isbn registration agency a directory of isbn agencies is available on the international isbn agency website
the registration group identifier is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element ie one of 978 or 979 registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element the single-digit group identifiers within the 978 prefix element are: 0 or 1 for english-speaking countries 2 for french-speaking countries 3 for german-speaking countries 4 for japan 5 for russian-speaking countries and 7 for people's republic of china an example 5-digit group identifier is 99936 for bhutan the allocated group ids are: 0–5 600–621 7 80–94 950–989 9926–9989 and 99901–99976 books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers
within the 979 prefix element the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with international standard music numbers ismns but such material is not actually assigned an isbn the registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for france 11 for the republic of korea and 12 for italy
the original 9-digit standard book number sbn had no registration group identifier but affixing a zero 0 as a prefix to a 9-digit sbn creates a valid 10-digit isbn
the national isbn agency assigns the registrant element cf category:isbn agencies and an accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of its books in most countries a book publisher is not required by law to assign an isbn however most book stores only handle isbn bearing merchandise
a listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published and can be ordered in book form €1399 us$1959 the web site of the isbn agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes partial lists have been compiled from library catalogs for the english-language groups: identifier 0 and identifier 1
publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers
by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements here are some sample isbn-10 codes illustrating block length variations
english-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 2 of more than 220 registration group elements these two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern which allows their length to be determined as follows:
a check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit it consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number the method for the ten digit code is an extension of that for sbns the two systems are compatible and sbn prefixed with 0 will give the same check-digit as without - the digit is base eleven and can be 0-9 or x the system for thirteen digit codes is not compatible and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 10 digit isbn and does not provide the same protection against transposition this is because the thirteen digit code was required to be compatible with the ean format and hence could not contain an x
the 2001 edition of the official manual of the international isbn agency says that the isbn-10 check digit – which is the last digit of the ten-digit isbn – must range from 0 to 10 the symbol x is used for 10 and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of 11
for example for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-2:
formally using modular arithmetic we can say:
it is also true for isbn-10's that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10 is a multiple of 11 for this example:
formally we can say:
the two most common errors in handling an isbn eg typing or writing it are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits it can be proved that all possible valid isbn-10's have at least two digits different from each other it can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid isbn-10's with eight identical digits and two transposed digits these are true only because the isbn is less than 11 digits long and because 11 is a prime number the isbn check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error ie if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid isbn – the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11 however if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected the book will be issued with an invalid isbn
in contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered non-transposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid isbn number although it is still unlikely
modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11 each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit isbn—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by a number in a sequence from 10 to 2 and the remainder of the sum with respect to 11 is computed the resulting remainder plus the check digit must equal a multiple of 11 either 0 or 11 therefore the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11 modulo 11 taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0 without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 – 0 = 11 which is invalid strictly speaking the first modulo 11 is unneeded but it may be considered to simplify the calculation
for example the check digit for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615- is calculated as follows:
thus the check digit is 2 and the complete sequence is isbn 0-306-40615-2 the value required to satisfy this condition might be 10 if so an 'x' should be used
it is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples:
the modular reduction can be done once at the end as shown above in which case s could hold a value as large as 496 for the invalid isbn 99999-999-9-x or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition
the 2005 edition of the international isbn agency's official manual describes how the 13-digit isbn check digit is calculated the isbn-13 check digit which is the last digit of the isbn must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its integer weight alternating between 1 and 3 is a multiple of 10
formally using modular arithmetic we can say:
the calculation of an isbn-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit isbn thus excluding the check digit itself each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9 subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10 a zero 0 replaces a ten 10 so in all cases a single check digit results
for example the isbn-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615- is calculated as follows:
thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is isbn 978-0-306-40615-7
formally the isbn-13 check digit calculation is:
this check system – similar to the upc check digit formula – does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 the check digit will not catch their transposition for instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1 the correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum while if the digits are transposed 1 followed by a 6 the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9 however 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10 and so produce the same final result: both isbns will have a check digit of 7 the isbn-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit
additionally if the sum of the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th and 13th the total will always be divisible by 10 ie end in 0
the conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix 978 to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the isbn-13 algorithm
publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit publishers sometimes

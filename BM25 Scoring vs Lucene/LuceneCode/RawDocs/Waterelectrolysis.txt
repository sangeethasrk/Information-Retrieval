electrolysis of water - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
electrolysis of water is the decomposition of water h2o into oxygen o2 and hydrogen gas h2 due to an electric current being passed through the water
this technique can be used to make hydrogen fuel hydrogen gas and breathable oxygen though currently most industrial methods make hydrogen fuel from natural gas instead


jan rudolph deiman and adriaan paets van troostwijk used in 1789 an electrostatic machine to produce electricity which was discharged on gold electrodes in a leyden jar with water in 1800 alessandro volta invented the voltaic pile and a few weeks later william nicholson and anthony carlisle used it for the electrolysis of water when zénobe gramme invented the gramme machine in 1869 electrolysis of water became a cheap method for the production of hydrogen a method of industrial synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis was developed by dmitry lachinov in 1888
a dc electrical power source is connected to two electrodes or two plates typically made from some inert metal such as platinum stainless steel or iridium which are placed in the water hydrogen will appear at the cathode the negative electrode where electrons enter the water and oxygen will appear at the anode the positive electrode assuming ideal faradaic efficiency the amount of hydrogen generated is twice the amount of oxygen and both are proportional to the total electrical charge conducted by the solution however in many cells competing side reactions occur resulting in different products and less than ideal faradaic efficiency
electrolysis of pure water requires excess energy in the form of overpotential to overcome various activation barriers without the excess energy the electrolysis of pure water occurs very slowly or not at all this is in part due to the limited self-ionization of water pure water has an electrical conductivity about one millionth that of seawater many electrolytic cells may also lack the requisite electrocatalysts the efficiency of electrolysis is increased through the addition of an electrolyte such as a salt an acid or a base and the use of electrocatalysts
currently the electrolytic process is rarely used in industrial applications since hydrogen can currently be produced more affordably from fossil fuels
in pure water at the negatively charged cathode a reduction reaction takes place with electrons e from the cathode being given to hydrogen cations to form hydrogen gas the half reaction balanced with acid:
at the positively charged anode an oxidation reaction occurs generating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the circuit:
the same half reactions can also be balanced with base as listed below not all half reactions must be balanced with acid or base many do like the oxidation or reduction of water listed here to add half reactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base
combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:
the number of hydrogen molecules produced is thus twice the number of oxygen molecules assuming equal temperature and pressure for both gases the produced hydrogen gas has therefore twice the volume of the produced oxygen gas the number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number of generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated oxygen molecules
decomposition of pure water into hydrogen and oxygen at standard temperature and pressure is not favorable in thermodynamic terms
thus the standard potential of the water electrolysis cell is -1.23 v at 25 °c at ph 0 h = 1.0 m at 25 °c with ph 7 h = 1.0×10 m the potential is unchanged based on the nernst equation the thermodynamic standard cell potential can be obtained from standard-state free energy calculations to find δg° and then using the equation: δg°= -nfe°where e° is the cell potential in practice when an electrochemical cell is driven toward completion by applying reasonable potential it is kinetically controlled therefore activation energy ion mobility diffusion and concentration wire resistance surface hindrance including bubble formation causes electrode area blockage and entropy require a greater applied potential to overcome these factors
if the above described processes occur in pure water h cations will accumulate at the anode and oh anions will accumulate at the cathode this can be verified by adding a ph indicator to the water: the water near the anode is acidic while the water near the cathode is basic the negative hydroxide ions that approach the anode mostly combine with the positive hydronium ions h3o to form water the positive hydronium ions that approach the negative cathode mostly combine with negative hydroxide ions to form water relatively few hydronium hydroxide ions reach the cathode anode this can cause a concentration overpotential at both electrodes
pure water is a fairly good insulator since it has a low autoionization kw = 1.0 x 10 at room temperature and thus pure water conducts current poorly 0.055 µs·cm unless a very large potential is applied to cause an increase in the autoionization of water the electrolysis of pure water proceeds very slowly limited by the overall conductivity
if a water-soluble electrolyte is added the conductivity of the water rises considerably the electrolyte disassociates into cations and anions the anions rush towards the anode and neutralize the buildup of positively charged h there similarly the cations rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of negatively charged oh there this allows the continued flow of electricity
care must be taken in choosing an electrolyte since an anion from the electrolyte is in competition with the hydroxide ions to give up an electron an electrolyte anion with less standard electrode potential than hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide and no oxygen gas will be produced a cation with a greater standard electrode potential than a hydrogen ion will be reduced in its stead and no hydrogen gas will be produced
the following cations have lower electrode potential than h and are therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cations: li rb k cs ba sr ca na and mg sodium and lithium are frequently used as they form inexpensive soluble salts
if an acid is used as the electrolyte the cation is h and there is no competitor for the h created by disassociating water the most commonly used anion is sulfate so2− 4 as it is very difficult to oxidize with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the peroxydisulfate ion being −2.05 volts
strong acids such as sulfuric acid h2so4 and strong bases such as potassium hydroxide koh and sodium hydroxide naoh are frequently used as electrolytes due to their strong conducting abilities
a solid polymer electrolyte can also be used such as nafion and when applied with a special catalyst on each side of the membrane can efficiently split the water molecule with as little as 1.5 volts there are also a number of other solid electrolyte systems that have been trialled and developed with a number of electrolysis systems now available commercially that use solid electrolytes
two leads running from the terminals of a battery are placed in a cup of water with a quantity of electrolyte to establish conductivity in the solution using nacl table salt in an electrolyte solution results in chlorine gas rather than oxygen due to a competing half-reaction with the correct electrodes and correct electrolyte such as baking soda sodium bicarbonate hydrogen and oxygen gases will stream from the oppositely charged electrodes oxygen will collect at the positively charged electrode anode and hydrogen will collect at the negatively charged electrode cathode note that hydrogen is positively charged in the h2o molecule so it ends up at the negative electrode and vice versa for oxygen
note that an aqueous solution of water with chloride ions when electrolysed will result in either oh if the concentration of cl is low or in chlorine gas being preferentially discharged if the concentration of cl is greater than 25% by mass in the solution

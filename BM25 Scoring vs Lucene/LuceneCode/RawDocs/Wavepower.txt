wave power - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
wave power is the transport of energy by ocean surface waves and the capture of that energy to do useful work – for example electricity generation water desalination or the pumping of water into reservoirs a machine able to exploit wave power is generally known as a wave energy converter wec
wave power is distinct from the diurnal flux of tidal power and the steady gyre of ocean currents wave-power generation is not currently a widely employed commercial technology although there have been attempts to use it since at least 1890 in 2008 the first experimental wave farm was opened in portugal at the aguçadoura wave park


waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea as long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave crest as well as friction on the water surface by the wind making the water to go into the shear stress causes the growth of the waves
wave height is determined by wind speed the duration of time the wind has been blowing fetch the distance over which the wind excites the waves and by the depth and topography of the seafloor which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves a given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves when this limit has been reached the sea is said to be fully developed
in general larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed wavelength and water density
oscillatory motion is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth however for standing waves clapotis near a reflecting coast wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth producing microseisms these pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power
the waves propagate on the ocean surface and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the group velocity the mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical plane of unit width parallel to a wave crest is called the wave energy flux or wave power which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device
in deep water where the water depth is larger than half the wavelength the wave energy flux is
with p the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length hm0 the significant wave height te the wave energy period ρ the water density and g the acceleration by gravity the above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the square of the wave height when the significant wave height is given in metres and the wave period in seconds the result is the wave power in kilowatts kw per metre of wavefront length
example: consider moderate ocean swells in deep water a few km off a coastline with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds using the formula to solve for power we get
meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest
in major storms the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds according to the above formula such waves carry about 1.7 mw of power across each metre of wavefront
an effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux as a result the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device
in a sea state the averagemean energy density per unit area of gravity waves on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared according to linear wave theory:
where e is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area j m the sum of kinetic and potential energy density per unit horizontal area the potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy both contributing half to the wave energy density e as can be expected from the equipartition theorem in ocean waves surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few decimetres
as the waves propagate their energy is transported the energy transport velocity is the group velocity as a result the wave energy flux through a vertical plane of unit width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction is equal to:
with cg the group velocity m s due to the dispersion relation for water waves under the action of gravity the group velocity depends on the wavelength λ or equivalently on the wave period t further the dispersion relation is a function of the water depth h as a result the group velocity behaves differently in the limits of deep and shallow water and at intermediate depths:
deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength which is the common situation in the sea and ocean in deep water longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster the deep-water group velocity is half the phase velocity in shallow water for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth as found quite often near the coast the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity
the first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799 and was filed in paris by girard and his son an early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by bochaux-praceique to light and power his house at royan near bordeaux in france it appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device from 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the uk alone
modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by yoshio masuda's experiments in the 1940s he has tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea with several hundred units used to power navigation lights among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft which was proposed in the 1950s by masuda
a renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the oil crisis in 1973 a number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves among whom notably were stephen salter from the university of edinburgh kjell budal and johannes falnes from norwegian institute of technology now merged into norwegian university of science and technology michael e mccormick from us naval academy david evans from bristol university michael french from university of lancaster nick newman and c c mei from mit
stephen salter's 1974 invention became known as salter's duck or nodding duck although it was officially referred to as the edinburgh duck in small scale controlled tests the duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency
in the 1980s as the oil price went down wave-energy funding was drastically reduced nevertheless a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea more recently following the issue of climate change there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy including wave energy
the world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the uk based in orkney scotland the european marine energy centre emec has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world emec provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions it's grid connected wave test site is situated at billia croo on the western edge of the orkney mainland and is subject to the full force of the atlantic ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include aquamarine power pelamis wave power scottishpower renewables and wello
wave power devices are generally categorized by the method used to capture the energy of the waves by location and by the power take-off system locations are shoreline nearshore and offshore types of power take-off include: hydraulic ram elastomeric hose pump pump-to-shore hydroelectric turbine air turbine and linear electrical generator when evaluating wave energy as a technology type it is important to distinguish be

clothes dryer - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
a clothes dryer tumble dryer or drying machine is a powered household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of clothing and other textiles usually shortly after they are washed in a washing machine clothes may also be dried by natural evaporation and if available sunlight on an outdoor or indoor clothes line or clothes horse
many dryers consist of a rotating drum called a tumbler through which heated air is circulated to evaporate the moisture while the tumbler is rotated to maintain air space between the articles using these machines may cause clothes to shrink or become less soft due to loss of short soft fibers lint a simpler non-rotating machine called a drying cabinet may be used for delicate fabrics and other items not suitable for a tumble dryer


tumbler dryers continuously draw in the cool dry ambient air around them and heat it before passing it through the tumbler the resulting hot humid air is usually vented outside to make room for more dry air to continue the drying process this design makes no effort to recycle the heat put into the load and thus is considered environmentally wasteful nevertheless it is simple and reliable and therefore has been widely used
improvised methods of salvaging this heat for in-home heating by use of inline vent boxes equipped with a flapper valve to redirect moist heated air to indoor areas will also increase humidity within a dwelling although this may be beneficial in dry winter conditions excess humidity from these devices increases likelihood of mold mildew and bacterial growth inside a home indoor venting may also be against local regulations gas dryers must always be vented outdoors as the products of combustion are mixed with the moist air building codes and manufacturers' instructions usually recommended that dryers vent outdoors an indoor lint trap kit poses a similar concern of increased humidity within the dwelling
long run dryers have an additional fan inside to boost the exiting moist air through longer sections of vent pipe as in apartments or dwellings where the vent cannot make a short direct connection from the dryer to the outside
beyond issues with venting exhaust other improvised efficiency efforts with conventional dryers attempt to harvest an input source of pre-heated air rather than using the conditioned air of the living space one notable source of heat to pre-heat dryer air is to install ductwork allowing the device to suck hot air from a dwelling's attic
these centrifuge machines simply spin their drums much faster than a typical washer could in order to extract additional water from the load they may remove more water in two minutes than a heated tumbler dryer can in twenty thus saving significant amounts of time and energy although spinning alone will not completely dry clothing this additional step saves a worthwhile amount of time and energy for large laundry operations such as those of hospitals
in some cases dryers may use spin alone larger gyms and swimming pools may have small spin dryers for the convenience of exiting patrons extracting much of the water from a swimsuit means fewer problems in gym bags and later laundry hampers full drying is not necessary as the patron typically launders the swimsuit soon afterwards
just as in a normal dryer condenser or condensation dryers pass heated air through the load however instead of exhausting this air the dryer uses a heat exchanger to cool the air and condense the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a collection tank the dryer air is run through the loop again the heat exchanger typically uses ambient air as its coolant therefore the heat produced by the dryer will go into the immediate surroundings instead of the outside increasing the room temperature in some designs cold water is used in the heat exchanger eliminating this heating but requiring increased water usage
in terms of energy use condenser dryers typically require slightly more power than conventional dryers typically on the order of ~15%
because the heat exchange process simply cools the internal air using ambient air or cold water in some cases it will not dry the air in the internal loop to as low a level of humidity as typical fresh ambient air as a consequence of the increased humidity of the air used to dry the load this type of dryer requires somewhat more time than a traditional dryer condenser dryers are a particularly attractive option where long intricate ducting would be required to vent a traditional dryer
a closed-cycle heat pump clothes dryer uses a heat pump to dehumidify the processing air such dryers typically use less than half the energy per load of a condenser dryer whereas condensation dryers use a passive heat exchanger cooled by ambient air these dryers use a heat pump the hot humid air from the tumbler is passed through a heat pump where the cold side condenses the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a collection tank and the hot side reheats the air afterwards for re-use in this way not only does the dryer avoid the need for ducting but it also conserves much of its heat within the dryer instead of exhausting it into the surroundings heat pump dryers can therefore use up to 50% less energy required by either condensation or traditional dryers domestic heat pump dryers are designed to work in typical ambient temperatures from 5 to 30 °c below 5 °c drying times significantly increase
as with condensation dryers the heat exchanger will not dry the internal air to as low a level of humidity as the typical ambient air with respect to ambient air the higher humidity of the air used to dry the clothes has the effect of increasing drying times however because heat pump dryers conserve much of the heat of the air they use the already-hot air can be cycled more quickly possibly leading to shorter drying times than traditional dryers depending on the model
a new type of dryer in development these machines are a more advanced version of heat pump dryers instead of using hot air to dry the clothing mechanical steam compression dryers use water recovered from the clothing in the form of steam first the tumbler and its contents are heated to 100 °c the wet steam that results purges the system of air and is the only remaining atmosphere in the tumbler
as wet steam exits the tumbler it is mechanically compressed hence the name to extract water vapor and transfer the heat of vaporization to the remaining gaseous steam this pressurized gaseous steam is then allowed to expand and is superheated before being injected back into the tumbler where its heat causes more water to vaporize from the clothing creating more wet steam and restarting the cycle
like heat pump dryers mechanical steam compression dryers recycle much of the heat used to dry the clothes and they operate in a very similar range of efficiency as heat pump dryers both types can be over twice as efficient as traditional dryers the considerably higher temperatures used in mechanical steam compression dryers result in drying times on the order of half as long as those of heat pump dryers
marketed by some manufacturers as a static clothes drying technique convectant dryers simply consist of a heating unit at the bottom a vertical chamber and a vent at top the unit heats air at the bottom reducing its relative humidity and the natural tendency of hot air to rise brings this low-humidity air into contact with the clothes this design is slow but relatively energy-efficient it is only marginally faster than line-drying
the solar dryer is a box-shaped stationary construction which encloses a second compartment where the clothes are held it uses the sun's heat without direct sunlight reaching the clothes alternatively a solar heating box may be used to heat air that is driven through a conventional tumbler dryer
japanese manufacturers have developed highly efficient clothes dryers that use microwave radiation to dry the clothes though a vast majority of japanese air dry their laundry most of the drying is done using microwaves to evaporate the water but the final drying is done by convection heating to avoid problems of a

feed-in tariff - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
a feed-in tariff fit standard offer contract advanced renewable tariff or renewable energy payments is a policy mechanism designed to accelerate investment in renewable energy technologies it achieves this by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers typically based on the cost of generation of each technology rather than pay an equal amount for energy however generated technologies such as wind power for instance are awarded a lower per-kwh price while technologies such as solar pv and tidal power are offered a higher price reflecting costs that are higher at the moment
in addition feed-in tariffs often include tariff degression a mechanism according to which the price or tariff ratchets down over time this is done in order to track and encourage technological cost reductions the goal of feed-in tariffs is to offer cost-based compensation to renewable energy producers providing price certainty and long-term contracts that help finance renewable energy investments
fits typically include three key provisions:
under a feed-in tariff eligible renewable electricity generators including homeowners business owners farmers and private investors are paid a cost-based price for the renewable electricity they supply to the grid this enables diverse technologies wind solar biogas etc to be developed and provides investors a reasonable return this principle was explained in germany's 2000 res act:
the compensation rateshave been determined by means of scientific studies subject to the provision that the rates identified should make it possible for an installation – when managed efficiently – to be operated cost-effectively based on the use of state-of-the-art technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally available in a given geographical environment
as a result the tariff or rate may differ by technology location eg rooftop or ground-mounted for solar pv projects size residential or commercial scale and region the tariffs are typically designed to decline over time to track and encourage technological change
fits typically offer a guaranteed purchase agreement for long 15–25 year periods
performance-based rates give incentives to producers to maximize the output and efficiency of their project
as of 2010 feed-in tariff policies had been enacted in over 50 countries including algeria australia austria belgium brazil canada china cyprus the czech republic denmark estonia france germany greece hungary iran republic of ireland israel italy kenya the republic of korea lithuania luxembourg the netherlands portugal south africa spain switzerland tanzania thailand turkey and the united kingdom in early 2012 in spain the rajoy administration suspended the feed-in tariff for new projects
in 2008 a detailed analysis by the european commission concluded that well-adapted feed-in tariff regimes are generally the most efficient and effective support schemes for promoting renewable electricity this conclusion was supported by other analyses including by the international energy agency the european federation for renewable energy as well as by deutsche bank
a feed in tariff can differentiate on the basis of marginal cost this is a theoretical alternative which is based on the concept of price differentiation finon under such a policy the tariff price ranges from some level slightly above the spot rate to the price required to obtain the optimal level of production determined by the government firms with lower marginal costs receive prices on the lower end of the spectrum that increase their revenue but not by as much as under the uniform feed in tariff the more marginal producers face the higher tariff price this version of the policy has two objectives the first is to reduce the profitability of certain production cites many renewable sources are highly dependent on their location for example windmills are most profitable in windy locations and solar plants are best at sunny locations this means that generators tend to be concentrated at these most profitable sites the differentiated tariff seeks to make less naturally productive sites more profitable and so spread out the generators which many consider to be an undesirable good in the area finon imagine cutting down all the forests to build wind farms this would not be good for the environment this however leads to a less cost effective production of renewable electricity as the most efficient sites are being under utilized the other goal of tariffs differentiated by marginal cost is to reduce the cost of the program finon under the uniform tariff all producers received the same price which was at times in gross excess of the price needed to incentivize them to produce the additional revenue translates into profit thus the differentiated tariff attempts to give each producer what it requires to maintain production so that the optimal market quantity of renewable energy production can be reached finon
overall and in light of incipient globalization feed-in tariffs are posing increasing problems from the point of view of trade as their implementation in one country can easily affect industries and policies of others thus requiring an ideally global coordination of treatment and imposition of such policy instrument which could be reached at the world trade organization
there are three methods of compensation
the first form of feed-in tariff under another name was implemented in the us in 1978 under president jimmy carter who signed the national energy act nea this law included five separate acts one of which was the public utility regulatory policies act purpa the purpose of the national energy act was to encourage energy conservation and develop new energy resources including renewables such as wind solar and geothermal power
within purpa was a provision that required utilities to purchase electricity generated from qualifying independent power producers at rates not to exceed their avoided cost avoided costs were designed to reflect the cost that a utility would incur to provide that same electrical generation different interpretations of purpa prevailed in the 1980s: some utilities and state utility commissions interpreted avoided costs narrowly to mean avoided fuel costs while others chose to define avoided costs as the avoided long-run marginal cost of generation the long-run costs referred to the anticipated cost of electricity in the years ahead this last approach was adopted by california in its standard offer contract no 4 another provision included in the purpa law was that utilities were prevented from owning more than 50% of projects to encourage new entrants
to comply with purpa some states began offering standard offer contracts to producers california's public utility commission established a number of standard offer contracts including standard offer no4 so4 which made use of fixed prices based on the expected long-run cost of generation the long-run estimates of electricity costs were based on the belief widely held at the time that oil and gas prices would continue to increase this led to an escalating schedule of fixed purchase prices designed to reflect the long-run avoided costs of new electrical generation by 1992 private power producers had installed approximately 1,700 mw of wind capacity in california some of which is still in service today the adoption of purpa also led to significant renewable energy generation in states such as florida and maine
this notwithstanding purpa retains negative connotations in the us electricity industry when oil and gas prices plummeted in the late 1980s the standard offer contracts that were signed to encourage new renewable energy development seemed high by comparison as a result purpa contracts came to be seen as an expensive burden on electricity ratepayers
another source of opposition to purpa stemmed from the fact that it was designed to encourage non-utility generation this was interpreted as a threat by many large utilities particularly monopolistic suppliers as a result of its encouragement of non-utility generation purpa has also been interpreted as an important step toward increasing competition
in 1990 germany adopted its stromeinspeisungsgesetz streg or law on feeding electricity into the grid the streg required utilities to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy suppliers at a percentage of the prevailing retail price of electricity the percentage offered to solar and wind power was set at 90% of the residential electricity price while other technologies such as hydro power and biomass sources were offered percentages ranging from 65–80% a project cap of 5 mw was included
while germany's streg was insufficient to encourage costlier technologies such as photovoltaics it proved relatively effective at encouraging lower-cost technologies such as wind leading to the deployment of 4,400 mw of new wind capacity between 1991 and 1999 representing approximately one third of the global capacity at the time
an additional challenge that streg addressed was the right to interconnect to the grid the streg guaranteed renewable electricity producers grid access similar percentage-based feed-in laws were adopted in spain as well as in denmark in the 1990s
germany's feed-in law underwent a major restructuring in 2000 re-framed as the act on granting priority to renewable energy sources erneuerbare energien gesetz german renewable energy act in its new form it proved to be the world's most effective policy framework at accelerating the renewable deployment
important changes included:
since it was the most successful the german policy amended in 2004 and 2008 often was the benchmark against which other feed-in tariff policies were considered
other countries followed the german approach long-term contracts are typically offered in a non-discriminatory manner to all renewable energy producers because purchase prices are based on costs efficiently operated projects yield a reasonable rate of return
this principle was stated as:
the compensation rateshave been determined by means of scientific studies subject to the proviso that the rates identified should make it possible for an installation – when managed efficiently – to be operated cost-effectively based on the use of state-of-the-art technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally available in a given geographical environment
feed-in tariff policies typically target a 5–10% return
feed-in tariffs refit supported growth in solar power in spain germany and wind power in denmark
the success of photovoltaics in germany resulted in an electricity price drop of up to 40% during peak output times with savings between €520 million and 840 million for consumers savings for consumers have meant conversely reductions in the profit margin of big electric power companies who reacted by lobbying the german government which reduced subsidies in 2012 energy utilities lobbied for the abolition or against the introduction of feed-in tariffs in other parts of the world including australia and california increase in the solar energy share in germany also had the effect of closing gas- and coal-fired generation plants
fits have had both increased and decreased effects on electricity prices
increases have been attributed to the fact that renewable energy is typically more expensive than electricity generated from conventional sources increases of approximately four euros per month per household were recorded in germany however renewable energy can reduce spot market prices via the merit order effect the practice of using higher-cost fossil fuel facilities only when demand exceeds the capacity of lower cost facilities this has led to electricity price reductions in spain denmark and germany
grid parity occurs when the cost of an alternative technology for electricity production matches the existing average for the area parity can vary both in time ie during the course of the day and over the course of years and in space ie geographically the price of electricity from the grid varies widely from high-cost areas such as hawaii and california to lower-cost areas such as wyoming and idaho in areas with time-of-day pricing rates vary over the course of the day rising during high-demand hours eg 11 am–8 pm and declining during low-demand hours
in some areas wind power landfill gas and biomass generation are already lower-cost than grid electricity parity has already been achieved in areas that use feed-in tariffs for example generation cost from landfill gas systems in germany are currently lower than the average electricity spot market price in remote areas electricity from solar photovoltaics can be cheaper than building new distribution lines to connect to the transmission grid
renewable portfolio standards rps and subsidies create protected markets for renewable energy rps require utilities to obtain a minimum percentage of their energy from renewable sources in some states utilities can purchase renewable energy certificates usa renewable energy certificate system eu renewable energy certificates registry aus to meet this requirement these certificates are issued to renewable energy producers based on the amount of energy they feed into the grid selling the certificates is another way for the renewable producer to supplement its revenues
certificate prices fluctuate based on overall energy demand and competition among renewable producers if the amount of renewable energy produced exceeds the required amount certificate prices may crash as happened with carbon trading in europe this can damage the economic viability of the renewable producers
quota systems favor large vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour they are also more difficult to design and implement than an fit
feed-in tariff laws were in place in 46 jurisdictions globally by 2007 information about solar tariffs may be found in a consolidated form however not all of the countries are listed in this source
to cover the additional costs of producing electricity from renewables and for the costs of diversification producers of electricity from renewables receive a bonus for each kwh produced marketed or consumed for electricity generated from solar or radiant heat only the bonus is 300% of the price per kwh of electricity produced by the market operator defined by law 02-01 of 22 dhu el kaada 1422 corresponding to 5 february 2002 until the minimum contribution of solar energy represents 25% of all primary energy for electricity generated from facilities using solar thermal systems solar-gas hybrid the bonus is 200% of the price per kwh
for contributions of solar energy below 25% said bonus is paid in the following conditions:
the price of electricity is fixed by the creg gas and electricity regulatory commission according to the last decision which fixed it the consumer pays his electricity as below:
the other consumers industry agricultureetc they pay 4.17 dzd kwh
the feed-in tariff provides bonuses for electricity generated by cogeneration of 160% taking into account thermal energy use of 20% of all primary energy used the bonuses for solar generated electricity and cogeneration are cumulative remuneration of the generated electricity is guaranteed over the whole plant lifetime
feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2008 in south australia and queensland 2009 in the australian capital territory and victoria and 2010 in new south wales tasmania and western australia the northern territory offers only local feed-in tariff schemes a uniform federal scheme to supersede all state schemes was proposed by tasmanian greens senator christine milne but not enacted by mid-2011 feed-in tariff in nsw and act had been closed to new generators as the installed capacity cap had been reached in nsw both the feed-in tariff and the cap were cut due to the overly generous original settings the new conservative victorian government replaced the original feed-in tariff with a less generous transitional feed-in tariff of 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for any power generated excess to the generator's usage pending the outcome of an inquiry by the victorian competition and efficiency commission this does not meet the normal definition and has been referred to as a fake feed-in tariff it is actually net metering with a payment for any kilowatt credit instead of the normal roll over
ontario introduced a feed-in tariff in 2006 revised in 2009 and 2010 increasing from 42¢ kwh to 80.2¢ kwh for micro-scale ≤10 kw grid-tied photovoltaic projects and decreasing to 64.2¢ kwh for applications received after 2 july 2010 applications received prior to then had until 31 may 2011 to install the system to receive the higher rate ontario's fit program includes a tariff schedule for larger projects up to and including 10mw solar farms at a reduced rate as of april 2010 several hundred projects have been approved including 184 large scale projects worth $8 billion by april 2012 12,000 systems had been installed and the rate decreased to 54.9¢ kwh for applications received after 1 september 2011 the price schedule as 2013 revised solar prices down to 28-38¢ kwh
as of august 2011 a national solar tariff was issued at about us$0.15 per kwh
china set a tariff for new onshore wind power plants in a move to help struggling project operators to realise profits the national development and reform commission ndrc the country's economic planning agency announced four categories of onshore wind projects which according to region will be able to apply for the tariffs areas with better wind resources will have lower tariffs while those with lower outputs will be able to access more generous tariffs
the tariffs are set at 0.51 yuan us 0.075 gbp 0.05 0.54 yuan 0.58 yuan and 0.61 yuan these represent a significant premium on the average rate of 0.34 yuan per kilowatt-hour paid to coal-fired electricity generators
czech republic introduced a tariff with law no 180 2005 in 2005 the tariff is guaranted for 15–30 years depending on source supported sources are small hydropower up to 10 mw biomass biogas wind and photovoltaics as of 2010 the highest tariff is 12.25 czk kwh for small photovoltaic in 2010 over 1200 mw of photovoltaics were installed but at the end of the year the fit was eliminated for larger systems and reduced by 50% for smaller systems in 2011 no photovoltaic systems were installed
on the 20th of september 2014 the ministry of electricity announced the new feed-in tariff pricing for electricity generated by new and renewable energy sources for households and private sector companies the energy tariff has been divided into five categories so that the price per kilowatt for households is egp 0.84 but for 200 kilowatts of usage the price rises to egp 0.911 the third category between 200 to 500 kilowatts will be charged egp 0.973 while the fourth ranging from 500 kilowatts to 20 megawatts will be charged egp 0.973 per kilowatt per hour the last category which stretches between 20-50mw will be charged egp 1.02 per kilowatt per hourinstitutions that use over 50mw will be charged under a different system the sale price for power generated from wind is calculated by the number of operating hours and from 2500 hours up through 3000 hours the rate is egp 0.828the rate will be set at egp 0.684 for 3000–4000 hours
the government will purchase the electricity generated by investors taking inflation into account while consumption will be paid in local currency and depreciation rates reviewed after two years the ministry of finance will provide concessional subsidised bank financing for households and institutions using less than 200 kw at a rate of 4% and 8% for 200-500kw the government is preparing a law that would allow for state-owned lands to be made available for new energy production projects under a usufruct system in exchange for 2% of the energy produced the electricity companies will be obligated to purchase and transport the energy the new tariff system also includes a reduction in customs on new and renewable energy production supplies by 2% while the proportion of bank financing has been set at 40-60% the government hopes for new and renewable energy to account for 20% egypt’s total energy mix by 2020

the administrative procedure for ground-mounted pv systems was significantly modified in late 2009 the distinction between segments was essentially based on capacity which determines the complexity of the administrative process from 4 march to 30 september 2011 the tariff was attractive for installations only less than 100 kwp in size above 100 kwp the fit was 0,117 € kwh cutting into profits a call for tenders for pv projects above 250 kwp was launched on 15 september 2011 the projects were to be analysed on multiple criteria including the tariff rate requested by the applicant
on 19 april 2012 the fit for small systems was reduced to €0.1079 for ground mounted systems and to €0.1934 for residential rooftop arrays
first introduced in 2000 the erneuerbare-energien-gesetz eeg law is reviewed on a regular basis its predecessor was the 1991 stromeinspeisegesetz as of may 2008 the cost of the program added about €1.01 usd1.69 to each monthly residential electric bill in 2012 the costs have risen to €0.03592 kwh the impact to consumers by 2013 was over 200 euros a year and the phrase 'energy poverty' became common
tariff rates for pv electricity vary depending on system size and location in 2009 tariffs were raised for electricity immediately consumed rather than supplied to the grid with increasing returns if more than 30% of overall production is consumed on-site this is to incentivise demand-side management and help develop solutions to the intermittency of solar power tariff duration is usually 20 calendar years plus the year of installation systems receive the tariff in effect at the time of installation for the entire period
the feed-in tariff in force since 1 august 2004 was modified in 2008 in view of the unexpectedly high growth rates the depreciation was accelerated and a new category >1000 kwp was created with a lower tariff the facade premium was abolished in july 2010 the renewable energy sources act was again amended to reduce the tariffs by a further 16% in addition to the normal annual depreciation as the prices for pv-panels had dropped sharply in 2009 contract duration 20 years
the pv feed-in tariffs for 2013 are:

the dutch cabinet agreed on 27 march 2009 to implement some parts of a feed-in tariff in response to the global financial crisis the proposed regulation may adjust the quota incentive system as of the summer of 2009 the netherlands operated a subsidy system the subsidy budget has a quota for diverse types of energy at several tens of million euros the wind budget for wind was hardly used because the tariffs are too low the 2009 budget for wind on land was 900 mw incl unused 400 mw from 2008 only 2.5 mw was used dutch utilities have no obligation to buy energy from windparks the tariffs change annually this created uncertain investment conditions the subsidy system was introduced in 2008 the previous 2003 subsidy scheme ministeriële regeling milieukwaliteit elektriciteitsproductie ministerial regulation for environmental electricity production which was funded by charging 100 euro per household annually on top of energy taxes stopped in 2006 because it was seen as too expensive in 2009 dutch wind parks were still being built with grants from the old scheme the old and new subsidy scheme was funded from the general budget
a feed-in tariff was briefly adopted in 2011 but ended a month later in february
under the renewable energy act of 2008 the philippine energy regulatory commission can guarantee fixed rate per kilowatt-hour – the fit rates – for power producers harnessing renewable energy under the fit system in february 2015 the erc agreed to give a fit rate of p8.53 per kilowatt hour for 20 years to the burgos wind farm of the energy development corporation
south africa's national energy regulator nersa announced 31 march 2009 a system of feed-in tariffs designed to produce 10 tw-h of electricity per year by 2013 the tariffs were substantially higher than those in nersa's original proposal the tariffs differentiated by technology were to be paid for 20 years
nersa said in its release that the tariffs were based on the cost of generation plus a reasonable profit the tariffs for wind energy and concentrating solar power were among the most attractive worldwide
the tariff for wind energy 1.25 zar kwh €0.104 kwh was greater than that offered in germany and more than proposed in ontario canada
the tariff for concentrating solar 2.10 zar kwh was less than that in spain nersa's revised program followed extensive public consultation
stefan gsänger secretary general of the world wind energy association said south africa is the first african country to introduce a feed-in tariff for wind energy many small and big investors will now be able to contribute to the take-off of the wind industry in the country such decentralised investment will enable south africa to overcome its current energy crisis it will also help many south african communities to invest in wind farms and generate electricity new jobs and new income we are especially pleased as this decision comes shortly after the first north american feed-in law has been proposed by the government of the canadian province of ontario
however the tariff was abandoned before it began in favor of a competitive bidding process launched on 3 august 2011 under this bidding process the south african government planned to procure 3,750mw of renewable energy: 1,850mw of onshore wind 1,450mw of solar pv 200mw of csp 75mw of small hydro 25mw of landfill gas 12.5mw of biogas 12.5mw of biomass and 100mw of small projects the bidding process comprised two steps:
the first round of bids was due on 4 november 2011 ppa's were expected to be in place by june 2012 projects should be commissioned by june 2014 except csp projects expected by june 2015
spanish feed-in legislation was set by royal decree 1578 2008 real decreto 1578 2008 for photovoltaic installations and royal decree 661 2007 for other renewable technologies injecting electricity to the public grid originally under the 661 2007 photovoltaic tariffs were developed under a separate law due to its rapid growth
the decree 1578 2008 categorized installations in two main groups with differentiated tariffs:
for other technologies decree 661 2007 setd up:
on 27 january 2012 the spanish government temporarily stopped accepting applications for projects beginning operation after january 2013 construction and operation of existing projects was not affected the country's electrical system had a €24 billion deficit fit payments did not contribute significantly to that deficit in 2008 the fit was expected to result in 400 mw of solar being installed however it was so high that over 2600 mw was installed utilities in spain reported that they had no way to pass on cost increases to consumers by increasing rates and instead accrued deficits although this is under dispute
switzerland introduced the so-called cost-covering remuneration for feed-in to the electricity grid crf on 1 may 2008
crf applies to hydropower up to 10 megawatts photovoltaics wind energy geothermal energy biomass and waste material from biomass and will be applicable for 20 and 25 years depending on the technology the implementation is done through the national grid operator swissgrid
while high by appearance crf has had little effect as the total amount of extra cost to the system was capped since about 2009 no more projects could be financed about 15'000 projects awaited allocation of monies if all those projects were implemented switzerland could mothball all its nuclear power plants which currently supply 40% of its power
in 2011 after fukushima some local power companies mostly owned by villages and cantons provinces selectively started offering their own tariff thereby creating a mini-boom
as of march 2012 the kev-fit for solar pv had been lowered several times to chf 0.30-0.40 kwh usd 0.33-0.44 kwh depending on size but was higher than in germany and most of the rest of the world
in 2006 the thai government enacted a tariff paid on top of utility avoided costs differentiated by technology type and generator size and guaranteed for 7–10 years solar received the highest amount 8 baht kwh about us cents 27 kwh large biomass projects received the lowest at 0.3 baht kwh at about 1 us cent per kwh additional per-kwh subsidies were provided for projects that offset diesel use in remote areas as of 2010 march 1364 mw of private sector renewable energy was online with an additional 4104 mw in the pipeline with signed ppas biomass made up the bulk of this capacity: 1292 mw online and 2119 mw ppa only solar electricity was second but growing more rapidly with 78 mw online and signed ppas for an additional 1759 mw
uganda launched a tariff in 2011 the uganda electricity transmission company limited held the transmission license in the country and was mandated by the electricity regulatory authority to provide the following fit for small-scale projects ranging from 0.5mw to 20mw
ukraine introduced the law 'on feed-in tariff' on 25 september 2008 the law guaranteed grid access for renewable energy producers small hydro up to 10 mw wind biomass photovoltaic and geothermal the tariffs for renewable power producers are set by the national regulator as of february 2013 the following tariffs per kwh were applied: biomass – uah 1.3446 eur 0.13 wind – uah 1.2277 eur 0.12 small hydro – uah 0.8418 eur 0.08 solar - uah 5.0509 eur 0.48 in case of significant fluctuations of the national currency against euro the feed-in tariff adjusts
in october 2008 the united kingdom announced that britain would implement a scheme by 2010 in addition to its current renewable energy quota scheme rocs in july 2009 britain's then-secretary of state for energy and climate change ed miliband presented details of the scheme which began in early april 2010
less than a year into the scheme in march 2011 the new coalition government announced that support for large-scale photovoltaic installations greater than 50 kw would be cut this was in response to european speculators lining up to establish huge solar farms in the west country that would have absorbed disproportionate amounts of the fund
on 9 june 2011 decc confirmed tariff cuts for solar pv systems above 50 kw after 1 august 2011 many were disappointed with decc's decision it was believed that the total subsidies for solar pv industry were unchanged but that tariffs for large systems would be cut to benefit smaller systems the fast track review was based on the long term plan to reach an annual installation of 1.9gw in 2020
in october 2011 decc announced dramatic cuts of around 55% to tariff rates with additional reductions for community or group schemes the cuts were to be effective from 12 december 2011 with a consultation exercise to end on 23 december 2011 this was successfully challenged in the high court by an application for judicial review jointly made by environmental pressure group friends of the earth foe and two solar companies - solarcentury and homesun the judgment made by mr justice mitting after a two-day court hearing was hailed as a major victory by green campaigners and the solar industry lawyers for the department of energy and climate change immediately moved to appeal the ruling the appeal was unanimously rejected by the supreme court allowing anyone who installed their systems before 3 march 2012 to receive the higher rate of 43.3 p kwh
the 30.7 p kwh rate was available for solar systems up to 5 mw and consequently no larger systems were built feed-in-tariff payments are tax-free in the united kingdom
as of april 2012 263,274 systems totaling 1,152.835 mw were receiving fit payments of these 260,041 were solar photovoltaic totaling 1,057.344 mw payments are for 25 years a typical photovoltaic system costing £7,500 pays for itself in 7 years 8 months and generates £23,610 over 25 years

ethical consumerism - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
ethical consumerism alternatively called ethical consumption ethical purchasing moral purchasing ethical sourcing ethical shopping or green consumerism is a type of consumer activism that is based on the concept of dollar voting it is practiced through 'positive buying' in that ethical products are favoured or 'moral boycott' that is negative purchasing and company-based purchasing
the term ethical consumer now used generically was first popularised by the uk magazine ethical consumer first published in 1989 ethical consumer magazine's key innovation was to produce 'ratings tables' inspired by the criteria-based approach of the then emerging ethical investment movement ethical consumer's ratings tables awarded companies negative marks and from 2005 overall scores across a range of ethical and environmental categories such as 'animal rights' 'human rights' and 'pollution and toxics' empowering consumers to make ethically informed consumption choices and providing campaigners with reliable information on corporate behaviour such criteria-based ethical and environmental ratings have subsequently become commonplace both in providing consumer information and in business-to-business corporate social responsibility and sustainability ratings such as those provided by innovest calvert foundation domini irrc tiaa–cref and kld analytics today bloomberg and reuters provide environmental social and governance ratings direct to the financial data screens of hundreds of thousands of stock market traders the not-for-profit ethical consumer research association continues to publish ethical consumer and its associated website which provides free access to ethical ratings tables


in unequal freedoms: the global market as an ethical system 1998 john mcmurtry argues that no purchasing decision exists that does not itself imply some moral choice and that there is no purchasing that is not ultimately moral in nature this mirrors older arguments especially by the anabaptists eg mennonites amish that one must accept all personal moral and spiritual liability of all harms done at any distance in space or time to anyone by one's own choices it is often suggested that judeo-christian scriptures further direct followers towards practising good stewardship of the earth under an obligation to a god who is believed to have created the planet for us to share with other creatures a similar argument presented from a secular humanist point of view is that it is simply better for human beings to acknowledge that the planet supports life only because of a delicate balance of many different factors
some trust criteria eg creditworthiness or implied warranty are considered to be part of any purchasing or sourcing decision however these terms refer to broader systems of guidance that would ideally cause any purchasing decision to disqualify offered products or services based on non-price criteria that affect the moral rather than the functional liabilities of the entire production process paul hawken a proponent of natural capitalism refers to comprehensive outcomes of production services as opposed to the culminative outcomes of using the product of such services often moral criteria are part of a much broader shift away from commodity markets towards a deeper service economy where all activities from growing to harvesting to processing to delivery are considered part of the value chain and for which consumers are responsible
andrew wilson director of the uk's ashridge centre for business and society argues that shopping is more important than voting and that the disposition of money is the most basic role we play in any system of economics some theorists believe that it is the clearest way that we express our actual moral choices ie if we say we care about something but continue to buy from parties that have a high probability of risk of harm or destruction of that thing we don't really care about it we are practicing a form of simple hypocrisy
in an effort by churches to advocate moral and ethical consumerism many have become involved in the fair trade movement:
as large corporations have tried to position themselves as moral principled or ethical organisations the definition has become wider and means different things to different groups of people for example mcdonald's started to sell salads a more healthy choice and has a corporate social responsibility blog ethical consumerism can be seen as a movement in marketing which may or may not reflect actual changes in the practices of businesses particular areas of interest for large businesses are environmental impact and the treatment of workers at the bottom of the organisational hierarchy this change reflects an increasing awareness of ethical issues and corporate identity amongst mainstream consumers
a number of standards labels and marks have been introduced for ethical consumers such as the following:
along with disclosure of ingredients some mandatory labelling of origins of clothing or food is required in all developed nations this practice has been extended in some developing nations eg where every item carries the name phone number and fax number of the factory where it was made so a buyer can inspect its conditions and more importantly to prove that the item was not made by prison labor use of which to produce export goods is banned in most developed nations such labels have also been used for boycotts as when the merchandise mark made in germany was introduced in 1887
these labels serve as tokens of some reliable validation process some instructional capital much as does a brand name or a nation's flag they also signal some social capital or trust in some community of auditors that must follow those instructions to validate those labels
some companies in the united states though currently not required to reduce their carbon footprint are doing so voluntarily by changing their energy use practices as well as by directly funding through carbon offsets businesses that are already sustainable—or are developing or improving green technologies for the future
in 2009 atlanta's virginia-highland neighborhood became the first carbon-neutral zone in the united states seventeen merchants in virginia-highland allowed their carbon footprint to be audited now they are partnered with the valley wood carbon sequestration project—thousands of acres of forest in rural georgia—through the chicago climate exchange ccx the businesses involved in the partnership display the verus carbon neutral seal in each store front and posted a sign prominently declaring the area's carbon neutral status ccx ceased trading carbon credits at the end of 2010 due to inactivity in the us carbon markets although carbon exchanges were intended to still be facilitated
over time some theorists suggest the amount of social capital or trust invested in nation-states or flags will continue to decrease and that placed in corporations or brands will increase this can only be offset by retrenched national sovereignty to reinforce shared national standards in tax trade and tariff laws and by placing the trust in civil society in such moral labels these arguments have been a major focus of the anti-globalization movement which includes many broader arguments against the amoral nature of markets as such however the economic school of public choice theory pioneered by james m buchanan has offered counter-arguments based on economic demonstration to this theory of 'amoral markets' versus 'moral governments'
ethical consumer research association the alternative consumer organisation collects and categorises information of more than 30,000 companies according to their performance in five main areas composing the ethiscore:

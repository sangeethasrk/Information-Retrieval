hydrogenation - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
hydrogenation – to treat with hydrogen – is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen h2 and another compound or element usually in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel palladium or platinum the process is commonly employed to reduce or saturate organic compounds hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of pairs of hydrogen atoms to a molecule generally an alkene catalysts are required for the reaction to be usable non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place only at very high temperatures hydrogenation reduces double and triple bonds in hydrocarbons
because of the importance of hydrogen many related reactions have been developed for its use most hydrogenations use gaseous hydrogen h2 but some involve the alternative sources of hydrogen not h2: these processes are called transfer hydrogenations the reverse reaction removal of hydrogen from a molecule is called dehydrogenation a reaction where bonds are broken while hydrogen is added is called hydrogenolysis a reaction that may occur to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom oxygen nitrogen or halogen bonds hydrogenation differs from protonation or hydride addition: in hydrogenation the products have the same charge as the reactants
hydrogenation of unsaturated fats produces saturated fats in the case of partial hydrogenation trans fats may be generated as well


hydrogenation has three components the unsaturated substrate the hydrogen or hydrogen source and invariably a catalyst the reduction reaction is carried out at different temperatures and pressures depending upon the substrate and the activity of the catalyst
the addition of h2 to an alkene affords an alkane in the prototypical reaction:
hydrogenation is sensitive to steric hindrance explaining the selectivity for reaction with the exocyclic double bond but not the internal double bond
an illustrative example of a hydrogenation reaction is the addition of hydrogen to maleic acid to form succinic acid numerous important applications of this petrochemical are found in pharmaceutical and food industries
an important characteristic of alkene and alkyne hydrogenations both the homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed versions is that hydrogen addition occurs with syn addition with hydrogen entering from the least hindered side typical substrates are listed in the table
with rare exceptions no reaction below 480 °c 750 k or 900 °f occurs between h2 and organic compounds in the absence of metal catalysts the unsaturated substrate is chemisorbed onto the catalyst with most sites covered by the substrate in heterogeneous catalysts hydrogen forms surface hydrides m-h from which hydrogens can be transferred to the chemisorbed substrate platinum palladium rhodium and ruthenium form highly active catalysts which operate at lower temperatures and lower pressures of h2 non-precious metal catalysts especially those based on nickel such as raney nickel and urushibara nickel have also been developed as economical alternatives but they are often slower or require higher temperatures the trade-off is activity speed of reaction vs cost of the catalyst and cost of the apparatus required for use of high pressures notice that the raney-nickel catalysed hydrogenations require high pressures:
two broad families of catalysts are known - homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts homogeneous catalysts dissolve in the solvent that contains the unsaturated substrate heterogeneous catalysts are solids that are suspended in the same solvent with the substrate or are treated with gaseous substrate
illustrative homogeneous catalysts include the rhodium-based compound known as wilkinson's catalyst and the iridium-based crabtree's catalyst an example is the hydrogenation of carvone:
hydrogenation is sensitive to steric hindrance explaining the selectivity for reaction with the exocyclic double bond but not the internal double bond
the activity and selectivity of homogeneous catalysts is adjusted by changing the ligands for prochiral substrates the selectivity of the catalyst can be adjusted such that one enantiomeric product is favored asymmetric hydrogenation is also possible via heterogeneous catalysis on a metal that is modified by a chiral ligand
heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation are more common industrially as in homogeneous catalysts the activity is adjusted through changes in the environment around the metal ie the coordination sphere different faces of a crystalline heterogeneous catalyst display distinct activities for example similarly heterogeneous catalysts are affected by their supports ie the material upon with the heterogeneous catalyst is bound
in many cases highly empirical modifications involve selective poisons thus a carefully chosen catalyst can be used to hydrogenate some functional groups without affecting others such as the hydrogenation of alkenes without touching aromatic rings or the selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes using lindlar's catalyst for example when the catalyst palladium is placed on barium sulfate and then treated with quinoline the resulting catalyst reduces alkynes only as far as alkenes the lindlar catalyst has been applied to the conversion of phenylacetylene to styrene
asymmetric hydrogenation is also possible via heterogeneous catalysis on a metal that is modified by a chiral ligand
for hydrogenation the obvious source of hydrogen is h2 gas itself which is typically available commercially within the storage medium of a pressurized cylinder the hydrogenation process often uses greater than 1 atmosphere of h2 usually conveyed from the cylinders and sometimes augmented by booster pumps gaseous hydrogen is produced industrially from hydrocarbons by the process known as steam reforming
hydrogen also can be extracted transferred from hydrogen-donors in place of h2 gas hydrogen donors which often serve as solvents include hydrazine dihydronaphthalene dihydroanthracene isopropanol and formic acid in organic synthesis transfer hydrogenation is useful for the asymmetric reduction of polar unsaturated substrates such as ketones aldehydes and imines
polar substrates such as nitriles can be hydrogenated electrochemically using protic solvents and reducing equivalents as the source of hydrogen
hydrogenation is a strongly exothermic reaction in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids for example the heat released is about 25 kcal per mole 105 kj mol sufficient to raise the temperature of the oil by 1.6–1.7 °c per iodine number drop the mechanism of metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes has been extensively studied first of all isotope labeling using deuterium confirms the regiochemistry of the addition:
on solids the accepted mechanism is the horiuti-polanyi mechanism:
in the second step the metallointermediate formed is a saturated compound that can rotate and then break down again detaching the alkene from the catalyst consequently contact with a hydrogenation catalyst necessarily causes cis-trans-isomerization because the isomerization is thermodynamically favorable this is a problem in partial hydrogenation while in complete hydrogenation the produced trans-alkene is eventually hydrogenated
for aromatic substrates the first bond is hardest to hydrogenate because of the free energy penalty for breaking the aromatic system the product of this is a cyclohexadiene which is extremely active and cannot be isolated in conditions reducing enough to break the aromatization it is immediately reduced to a cyclohexene the cyclohexene is ordinarily reduced immediately to a fully saturated cyclohexane but special modifications to the catalysts such as the use of the anti-solvent water on ruthenium can preserve some of the cyclohexene if that is a desired product
in many homogeneous hydrogenation processes the metal binds to both components to give an intermediate alkene-metalh2 complex the general sequence of reactions is assumed to be as follows or a related sequence of steps:
the hydrogenation of nitrogen to give ammonia is conducted on a vast scale by the haber-bosch process consuming an estimated 1% of the world's energy supply
oxygen can be partially hydrogenated to give hydrogen peroxide although this process has not been commercialized
catalytic hydrogenation has diverse industrial uses most frequently industrial hydrogenation relies on heterogeneous catalysts
the largest scale application of hydrogenation is for the processing of vegetable oils typical vegetable oils are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids containing more than one carbon-carbon double bond their partial hydrogenation reduces most but not all of these carbon-carbon double bonds the degree of hydrogenation is controlled by restricting the amount of hydrogen reaction temperature and time and the catalyst
hydrogenation converts liquid vegetable oils into solid or semi-solid fats such as those present in margarine changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties such as the melting range which is why liquid oils become semi-solid solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats are available in a wide range of consistencies and have other desirable characteristics such as increased oxidative stability and longer shelf life they are the predominant fats used as shortening in most commercial baked goods
a side effect of incomplete hydrogenation having implications for human health is the isomerization of some of the remaining unsaturated carbon bonds the cis configuration of these double bonds predominates in the unprocessed fats in most edible fat sources but incomplete hydrogenation partially converts these molecules to trans isomers which have been implicated in circulatory diseases including heart disease the conversion from cis to trans bonds is favored because the trans configuration has lower energy than the natural cis one at equilibrium the trans cis isomer ratio is about 2:1 food legislation in the us and codes of practice in eu have long required labels declaring the fat content of foods in retail trade and more recently have also required declaration of the trans fat content the use of trans fats in human food products has been effectively banned in denmark since 2003 and switzerland 2008 in the us local legislation banned trans fats from restaurants and public kitchens in new york city since 2005 and california other countries and regions have introduced mandatory labeling of trans fats on food products and appealed to the industry for voluntary reductions partially hydrogenated fats can be replaced for instance by interesterified fats or by formulation such as adding palm oil to unsaturate-rich oils
on june 16 2015 the us food and drug administration announced that the food industry would have a three-year time period to phase trans fats from the food supply
in petrochemical processes hydrogenation is used to convert alkenes and aromatics into saturated alkanes paraffins and cycloalkanes naphthenes which are less toxic and less reactive relevant to liquid fuels that are stored sometimes for long periods in air saturated hydrocarbons exhibit superior storage properties on the other hand alkene tend to form hydroperoxides which can form gums that interfere with fuel handing equipment for example mineral turpentine is usually hydrogenated hydrocracking of heavy residues into diesel is another application in isomerization and catalytic reforming processes some hydrogen pressure is maintained to hydrogenolyze coke formed on the catalyst and prevent its accumulation
hydrogenation is a useful means for converting unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes but also aldehydes imines and nitriles which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds ie alcohols and amines thus alkyl aldehydes which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene can be converted to alcohols eg 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde produced from ethene and carbon monoxide xylitol a polyol is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose an aldehyde primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile for example isophorone diamine a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation reductive amination by ammonia wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine
the earliest hydrogenation is that of platinum catalyzed addition of hydrogen to oxygen in the döbereiner's lamp a device commercialized as early as 1823 the french chemist paul sabatier is considered the father of the hydrogenation process in 1897 building on the earlier work of james boyce an american chemist working in the manufacture of soap products he discovered that the introduction of a trace of nickel as a catalyst facilitated the addition of hydrogen to molecules of gaseous hydrocarbons in what is now known as the sabatier process for this work sabatier shared the 1912 nobel prize in chemistry wilhelm normann was awarded a patent in germany in 1902 and in britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry the commercially important haber–bosch process first described in 1905 involves hydrogenation of nitrogen in the fischer–tropsch process reported in 1922 carbon monoxide which is easily derived from coal is hydrogenated to liquid fuels
also in 1922 voorhees and adams described an apparatus for performing hydrogenation under pressures above one atmosphere the parr shaker the first product to allow hydrogenation using elevated pressures and temperatures was commercialized in 1926 based on voorhees and adams' research and remains in widespread use in 1924 murray raney developed a nickel fine powder catalyst named after him which is still widely used in hydrogenation reactions such as conversion of nitriles to amines or the production of margarine
the history of homogeneous hydrogenation has been assigned to the development the meerwein–ponndorf–verley reduction of ketones using aluminium alkoxides in the 1930s calvin discovered that copperii complexes oxidized h2 the 1960s witnessed the development of well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal complexes eg wilkinson's catalyst rhclpph33 soon thereafter schrock and obsorne's discovered that cationic rh and ir catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyls in the 1970s asymmetric hydrogenation was demonstrated in the synthesis of l-dopa and the 1990s saw the invention of noyori asymmetric hydrogenation the development of homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the oxo process and ziegler–natta polymerization more recently homogeneous hydrogenation has been used to promote reductive c-c bond formation
for most practical purposes hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst hydrogenation can however proceed from some hydrogen donors without catalysts illustrative hydrogen donors being diimide and aluminium isopropoxide some metal-free catalytic systems have been investigated in academic research one such system for reduction of ketones consists of tert-butanol and potassium tert-butoxide and very high temperatures the reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation of benzophenone:
a chemical kinetics study found this reaction is first-order in all three reactants suggesting a cyclic 6-membered transition state
another system for metal-free hydrogenation is based on the phosphine-borane compound 1 which has been called a frustrated lewis pair it reversibly accepts dihydrogen at relatively low temperatures to form the phosphonium borate 2 which can reduce simple hindered imines
the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline has been reported to be catalysed by fullerene its mono-anion atmospheric hydrogen and uv light
today's bench chemist has three main choices of hydrogenation equipment:

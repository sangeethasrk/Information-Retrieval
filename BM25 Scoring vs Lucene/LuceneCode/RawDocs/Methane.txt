methane - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
methane  ˈmɛθeɪn  or  ˈmiːθeɪn  is a chemical compound with the chemical formula ch4 one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen it is the simplest alkane and the main component of natural gas the relative abundance of methane on earth makes it an attractive fuel though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under at normal conditions for temperature and pressure
in its natural state methane is found both below ground and under the sea floor when it finds its way to the surface and the atmosphere it is known as atmospheric methane the earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750 and it accounts for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases these gases don't include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect methane breaks down in the atmosphere and creates ch·3 with water vapor


in november 1776 methane was first scientifically identified by italian physicist alessandro volta in the marshes of lake maggiore straddling italy and switzerland volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by benjamin franklin about flammable air volta captured the gas rising from the marsh and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas he also demonstrated means to ignite the gas with an electric spark
methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent c–h bonds its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals mos resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on c and h the lowest energy mo is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of mos that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen the resulting three-over-one bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements
at room temperature and standard pressure methane is a colorless odorless gas the familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an odorant usually blends containing tert-butylthiol as a safety measure methane has a boiling point of −161 °c −257.8 °f at a pressure of one atmosphere as a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations 4.4–17% in air at standard pressure
solid methane exists in several modifications presently nine are known cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane i this substance crystallizes in the cubic system space group fm3m the positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane i ie methane molecules may rotate freely therefore it is a plastic crystal
the primary chemical reactions of methane are combustion steam reforming to syngas and halogenation in general methane reactions are difficult to control partial oxidation to methanol for example is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen the enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions
like other hydrocarbons methane is a very weak acid its pka in dmso is estimated to be 56 it cannot be deprotonated in solution but the conjugate base with methyllithium is known
a variety of positive ions derived from methane have been observed mostly as unstable species in low-pressure gas mixtures these include methenium or methyl cation ch+ 3 methane cation ch+ 4 and methanium or protonated methane ch+ 5 some of these have been detected in outer space methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with superacids cations with higher charge such as ch2+ 6 and ch3+ 7 have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable
despite the strength of its c–h bonds there is intense interest in catalysts that facilitate c–h bond activation in methane and other lower numbered alkanes
methane's heat of combustion is 55.5 mj kg combustion of methane is a multiple step reaction the following equations are part of the process with the net result being:
ch4 + 2 o2 → co2 + 2 h2o δh = −891 k j mol at standard conditions
the species m signifies an energetic third body from which energy is transferred during a molecular collision formaldehyde hcho or h 2co is an early intermediate reaction 7 oxidation of formaldehyde gives the formyl radical hco reactions 8–10 which then give carbon monoxide co reactions 11 12 & 13 any resulting h2 oxidizes to h2o or other intermediates reaction 14 15 finally the co oxidizes forming co2 reaction 16 in the final stages reactions 17–19 energy is transferred back to other third bodies the overall speed of reaction is a function of the concentration of the various entities during the combustion process the higher the temperature the greater the concentration of radical species and the more rapid the combustion process
given appropriate conditions methane reacts with halogens as follows:
where x is a halogen: fluorine f chlorine cl bromine br or iodine i this mechanism for this process is called free radical halogenation it is initiated with uv light or some other radical initiator a chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane resulting in the formation of hydrogen chloride the resulting methyl radical ch3• can combine with another chlorine molecule to give methyl chloride ch3cl and a chlorine atom this chlorine atom can then react with another methane or methyl chloride molecule repeating the chlorination cycle similar reactions can produce dichloromethane ch2cl2 chloroform chcl3 and ultimately carbon tetrachloride ccl4 depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio
methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid liquefied natural gas or lng while leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas of which methane is the principal component
methane is used as a fuel for ovens homes water heaters kilns automobiles turbines and other things it combusts with oxygen to create fire
methane is important for electrical generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator compared to other hydrocarbon fuels methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released at about 891 kj mol methane's heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but the ratio of the heat of combustion 891 kj mol to the molecular mass 16.0 g mol of which 12.0 g mol is carbon shows that methane being the simplest hydrocarbon produces more heat per mass unit 55.7 kj g than other complex hydrocarbons in many cities methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking in this context it is usually known as natural gas which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter or 1,000 btu per standard cubic foot
methane in the form of compressed natural gas is used as a vehicle fuel and is claimed to be more environmentally friendly than other fossil fuels such as gasoline petrol and diesel research into adsorption methods of methane storage for use as an automotive fuel has been conducted
liquefied natural gas lng is natural gas predominantly methane ch4 that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport
liquefied natural gas takes up about 1 600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state it is odorless colorless non-toxic and non-corrosive hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state freezing and asphyxia
the liquefaction process involves removal of certain components such as dust acid gases helium water and heavy hydrocarbons which could cause difficulty downstream the natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure maximum transport pressure set at around 25 kpa or 3.6 psi by cooling it to approximately −162 °c −260 °f
lng achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas cng so that the energy density of lng is 2.4 times greater than that of cng or 60% that of diesel fuel this makes lng cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist specially designed cryogenic sea vessels lng carriers or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport
lng when it is not highly refined for special uses is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas it is also beginning to be used in lng-fueled road vehicles for example trucks in commercial operation have been achieving payback periods of approximately four years on the higher initial investment required in lng equipment on the trucks and lng infrastructure to support fueling however it remains more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas as of 2002 the relatively higher cost of lng production and the need to store lng in more expensive cryogenic tanks had slowed widespread commercial use
in a highly refined form liquid methane is used as a rocket fuel
though methane has been investigated for decades no production methane engines have yet been used on orbital spaceflights this promises to change as liquid methane has recently been selected for the active development of a variety of bipropellant rocket engines
since the 1990s a number of russian rockets using liquid methane have been proposed one 1990s russian engine proposal was the rd-192 a methane lox variant of the rd-191
in 2005 us companies orbitech and xcor aerospace developed a demonstration liquid oxygen liquid methane rocket engine and a larger 7,500 pounds-force 33 kn-thrust engine in 2007 for potential use as the cev lunar return engine before the cev program was later cancelled
more recently the american private space company spacex announced in 2012 an initiative to develop liquid methane rocket engines including initially the very large raptor rocket engine raptor is being designed to produce 4.4 meganewtons 1,000,000 lbf of thrust with a vacuum specific impulse isp of 363 seconds and a sea-level isp of 321 seconds and began component-level testing in 2014 in february 2014 the raptor engine design was shown to be of the highly efficient and theoretically more reliable full-flow staged combustion cycle type where both propellant streams—oxidizer and fuel—are completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber prior to 2014 only two full-flow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle
in october 2013 the china aerospace science and technology corporation a state-owned contractor for the chinese space program announced that it had completed a first ignition test on a new lox methane rocket engine no engine size was provided
in september 2014 another american private space company—blue origin— publicly announced that they were into their third year of development work on a large methane rocket engine the new engine the blue engine 4 or be-4 has been designed to produce 2,400 kilonewtons 550,000 lbf of thrust while initially planned to be used exclusively on a blue origin proprietary launch vehicle it will now be used on a new united launch alliance ula engine on an new launch vehicle that is a successor to the atlas v ula indicated in 2014 that they will make the maiden flight of the new launch vehicle no earlier than 2019
one advantage of methane is that it is abundant in many parts of the solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body in particular using methane production from local materials found on mars or titan providing fuel for a return journey
by 2013 nasa's project morpheus had developed a small restartable lox methane rocket engine with 5,000 pounds-force 22 kn thrust and a specific impulse of 321 seconds suitable for inspace applications including landers small lox methane thrusters 5–15 pounds-force 22–67 n were also developed suitable for use in a reaction control system rcs
spacenews is reporting in early 2015 that the french space agency cnes is working with germany and a few other governments and will propose a lox methane engine on a reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015 with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026
although there is great interest in converting methane into useful or more easily liquefied compounds the only practical processes are relatively unselective in the chemical industry methane is converted to synthesis gas a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen by steam reforming this endergonic process requiring energy utilizes nickel catalysts and requires high temperatures around 700–1100 °c:
related chemistries are exploited in the haber-bosch synthesis of ammonia from air which is reduced with natural gas to a mixture of carbon dioxide water and ammonia
methane is also subjected to free-radical chlorination in the production of chloromethanes although methanol is a more typical precursor
naturally occurring methane is mainly produced by the process of methanogenesis this multistep process is used by microorganisms as an energy source the net reaction is:
the final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme coenzyme-b sulfoethylthiotransferase methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by organisms that occupy landfill ruminants eg cattle and the guts of termites
it is uncertain if plants are a source of methane emissions
power to gas is a technology which converts electrical power to a gas fuel the method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane see natural gas using electrolysis and the sabatier reaction excess and off-peak power generated by wind generators and solar arrays could theoretically be used for load balancing in the energy grid
methane can be produced by hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the sabatier process methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the fischer-tropsch process this technology is practiced on a large scale to produce longer chain molecules than methane
natural gas is so abundant that the intentional production of methane is relatively rare the only large scale facility of this kind is the great plains synfuels plant started in 1984 in beulah north dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low grade lignite a resource which is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight ash content low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport
an adaptation of the sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere
methane can also be produced by the destructive distillation of acetic acid in the presence of soda lime or similar acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process methane can also be prepared by reaction of aluminium carbide with water or strong acids
methane could also be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization involving water carbon dioxide and the mineral olivine which is known to be common on mars
methane was discovered and isolated by alessandro volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from lake maggiore it is the major component of natural gas about 87% by volume the major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source see coal bed methane extraction a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams it is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen methane is produced at shallow levels low pressure by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the earth's surface in general the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher tem

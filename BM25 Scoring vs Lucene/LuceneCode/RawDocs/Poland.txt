poland polish: polska ˈpɔlska  listen officially the republic of poland polish: rzeczpospolita polska  listen help·info is a country in central europe bordered by germany to the west the czech republic and slovakia to the south ukraine and belarus to the east and the baltic sea kaliningrad oblast a russian exclave and lithuania to the north the total area of poland is 312,679 square kilometres 120,726 sq mi making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in europe with a population of over 38.5 million people poland is the 34th most populous country in the world the 8th most populous country in europe and the sixth most populous member of the european union as well as the most populous post-communist member of the european union poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions
the establishment of a polish state can be traced back to 966 when mieszko i ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with that of present-day poland converted to christianity the kingdom of poland was founded in 1025 and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding political association with the grand duchy of lithuania by signing the union of lublin this union formed the polish–lithuanian commonwealth one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th and 17th-century europe the commonwealth ceased to exist in the years 1772–1795 when its territory was partitioned among prussia the russian empire and austria poland regained its independence as the second polish republic at the end of world war i in 1918
in september 1939 world war ii started with the invasions of poland by nazi germany and the soviet union as part of the molotov–ribbentrop pact more than six million polish citizens died in the war in 1944 a soviet-backed polish provisional government was formed which after a falsified referendum in 1947 took control of the country and poland became a satellite state of the soviet union as people's republic of poland during the revolutions of 1989 poland's communist government was overthrown and poland adopted a new constitution establishing itself as a democracy
despite the large number of casualties and destruction the country experienced during world war ii poland managed to preserve much of its cultural wealth there are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the unesco world heritage and 54 historical monuments and many objects of cultural heritage in poland
since the beginning of the transition to a primarily market-based economy that took place in the early 1990s poland has achieved a very high ranking on the human development index as well as gradually improving economic freedom poland is a democratic country with an advanced high-income economy a high quality of life and a very high standard of living moreover the country is visited by nearly 16 million tourists every year 2013 which makes it one of the most visited countries in the world poland is the sixth largest economy in the european union and among the fastest rising economic states in the world the country is the sole member nation of the european union to have escaped a decline in gdp and in recent years was able to create probably the most varied gdp growth in its history according to oanda a canadian-based foreign exchange company furthermore according to the global peace index for 2014 poland is one of the safest countries in the world to live in


the source of the name poland and the ethnonyms for the poles include endonyms the way polish people refer to themselves and their country and exonyms the way other peoples refer to the poles and their country endonyms and most exonyms for poles and poland derive from the name of the west slavic tribe of the polans polanie
the origin of the name polanie itself is uncertain it may derive from such polish words as pole field the early tribal inhabitants denominated it from the nature of the country lowlands and low hills predominate throughout the vast region from the baltic shores to the foothills of the carpathian mountains between the alps hungary and the ocean lies poland which is called in their native tongue campania latin: inter alpes huniae et oceanum est polonia sic dicta in eorum idiomate quasi campania is the description by gervase of tilbury in his otia imperialia recreation for the emperor of 1211 in some languages the exonyms for poland derive from another tribal name lechites lechici
historians have postulated that throughout late antiquity many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now poland the ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of these groups have been hotly debated the time and route of the original settlement of slavic peoples in these regions lacks written records and can only be defined as fragmented
the most famous archaeological find from the prehistory and protohistory of poland is the biskupin fortified settlement now reconstructed as an open-air museum dating from the lusatian culture of the early iron age around 700 bc the slavic groups who would form poland migrated to these areas in the second half of the 5th century ad up until the creation of mieszko's state and his subsequent conversion to christianity in 966 ad the main religion of slavic tribes that inhabited the geographical area of present-day poland was slavic paganism after the baptism of poland the new religion accepted by the polish ruler was catholicism the transition to christianity was not a smooth and instantaneous process for the rest of the population as evident from the pagan reaction of the 1030s
poland began to form into a recognizable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the piast dynasty poland's first historically documented ruler mieszko i accepted baptism in 966 and adopted christianity as the new official religion of his subjects the bulk of the population converted in the course of the next few centuries in 1000 boleslaw the brave continuing the policy of his father mieszko held a congress of gniezno and created the metropolis of gniezno and the dioceses of kraków kołobrzeg and wrocław the pagan unrest however led to the transfer of the capital to kraków in 1038 by casimir i the restorer
prince bolesław iii wrymouth defeated the king of germany henry v in the 1109 battle of hundsfeld writes gallus anonymus in his 1118 chronicle in 1138 poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when bolesław divided his lands among his sons in 1226 konrad i of masovia one of the regional piast dukes invited the teutonic knights to help him fight the baltic prussian pagans a decision which led to centuries of warfare with the knights elements of what is called now human rights may be found in early times of the polish state the statute of kalisz or the general charter of jewish liberties issued in 1264 introduced numerous right for the jews in poland leading to a nearly autonomous nation within a nation
in the middle of 13th-century the silesian branch of the piast dynasty henry i the bearded and henry ii the pious ruled 1238–1241 almost succeeded in uniting the polish lands but the mongols devastated the country and won the battle of legnica where duke henry ii the pious died 1241 in 1320 after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the polish dukedoms władysław i consolidated his power took the throne and became the first king of a reunified poland his son casimir iii reigned 1333–1370 has a reputation as one of the greatest polish kings and gained wide recognition for improving the country's infrastructure casimir also extended royal protection to jews and encouraged their immigration to poland
the education of polish society was a goal of rulers as early as the 12th century and polish nobility became one of the most educated groups in europe the library catalogue of the cathedral chapter of kraków dating back to 1110 shows that in the early 12th-century polish intellectuals had access to european literature
casimir iii realized that the nation needed a class of educated people especially lawyers who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices his efforts to found an institution of higher learning in poland were finally rewarded when pope urban v granted him permission to open the university of kraków
the golden liberty of the nobles began to develop under casimir's rule when in return for their military support the king made serious concessions to the aristocrats finally establishing their status as superior to that of the townsmen and aiding their rise to power when casimir died in 1370 he left no legitimate male heir and considering his other male descendants either too young or unsuitable was laid to rest as the last of the nation's piast rulers
poland also became a destination for german flemish and to a lesser extent scottish danish and walloon migrants the jewish community also began to settle and flourish in poland during this era see history of the jews in poland the same applies in smaller number to armenians the black death which afflicted most parts of europe from 1347 to 1351 affected poland less severely
the rule of the jagiellon dynasty spanned the late middle ages and early modern era of polish history beginning with the lithuanian grand duke jogaila władysław ii jagiełło the jagiellon dynasty 1386–1572 formed the polish–lithuanian union the partnership brought vast lithuania-controlled rus' areas into poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the poles and lithuanians who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in europe for the next four centuries in the baltic sea region poland's struggle with the teutonic knights continued and included the battle of grunwald 1410 where a polish-lithuanian army inflicted a decisive defeat on the teutonic knights both countries' main adversary allowing poland's and lithuania's territorial expansion into the far north region of livonia in 1466 after the thirteen years' war king casimir iv jagiellon gave royal consent to the milestone peace of thorn which created the future duchy of prussia a polish vassal the jagiellons at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of bohemia 1471 onwards and hungary in the south poland confronted the ottoman empire and the crimean tatars by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569 and in the east helped lithuania fight the grand duchy of moscow some historians estimate that crimean tatar slave-raiding cost poland one million of its population from 1494 to 1694
poland was developing as a feudal state with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful landed nobility the nihil novi act adopted by the polish sejm parliament in 1505 transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the sejm an event which marked the beginning of the period known as golden liberty when the state was ruled by the free and equal polish nobility protestant reformation movements made deep inroads into polish christianity which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance unique in europe at that time this tolerance allowed the country to avoid most the religious turmoil that spread over europe during the late middle ages the european renaissance evoked in late jagiellon poland kings sigismund i the old and sigismund ii augustus a sense of urgency in the need to promote a cultural awakening and during this period polish culture and the nation's economy flourished in 1543 the pole nicolaus copernicus an astronomer from toruń published his epochal works de revolutionibus orbium coelestium on the revolutions of the celestial spheres and thus became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming heliocentric theory which became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy another major figure associated with the era is classicist poet jan kochanowski
the 1569 union of lublin established the polish–lithuanian commonwealth a more closely unified federal state with an elective monarchy but which was governed largely by the nobility through a system of local assemblies with a central parliament the warsaw confederation 1573 confirmed the religious freedom of all residents of poland which was extremely important for the stability of the multiethnic polish society of the time serfdom was banned in 1588 the establishment of the commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in poland with the union thereafter becoming a european power and a major cultural entity occupying approximately one million square kilometers of central and eastern europe as well as an agent for the dissemination of 'western culture' through polonization in modern-day ukraine belarus and western russia poland suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the vasa kings sigismund iii and władysław iv and found itself engaged in major conflicts with russia sweden and the ottoman empire as well as a series of minor cossack uprisings in 1610 hetman stanisław żółkiewski seized moscow after winning the battle of klushino
from the middle of the 17th century the nobles' democracy suffering from internal disorder gradually declined thus leaving the once powerful commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention starting in 1648 the cossack khmelnytsky uprising engulfed the south and east eventually leaving ukraine divided with the eastern part lost by the commonwealth becoming a dependency of the tsardom of russia this was followed by the 'deluge' a swedish invasion which marched through the polish heartlands and damaged poland's population culture and infrastructure around four million of poland's eleven million population died in famines and epidemics in this period however under john iii sobieski the commonwealth's military prowess was re-established and in 1683 polish forces played a major part in relieving vienna of a turkish siege which was being conducted by kara mustafa
sobieski's reign marked the end of the nation's golden-era finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy the commonwealth fell into decline the government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts eg lubomirski rebellion against john ii casimir and rebellious confederations and corrupted legislative processes the nobility fell under the control of a handful of magnats and this compounded with two relatively weak kings of the saxon wettin dynasty augustus ii and augustus iii as well as the rise of russia and prussia after the great northern war only served to worsen the commonwealth's plight despite this the commonwealth-saxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the commonwealth's first reform movement and laid the foundations for the polish enlightenment
during the later part of the 18th century the commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education intellectual life art and especially toward the end of the period evolution of the social and political system the most populous capital city of warsaw replaced gdańsk danzig as the leading centre of commerce and the role of the more prosperous townsfolk increased
the royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of stanisław ii august a refined and worldly aristocrat connected to a major magnate faction to the monarchy however a one-time lover of empress catherine ii of russia the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation and his perceived necessity to remain in a relationship with his russian sponsor this led to the formation of the 1768 bar confederation a szlachta rebellion directed against russia and the polish king that fought to preserve poland's independence and the szlachta's traditional privileges attempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours and in 1772 the first partition of the commonwealth by russia austria and prussia took place an act which the partition sejm under considerable duress eventually ratified fait accompli disregarding this loss in 1773 the king established the commission of national education the first government education authority in europe corporal punishment of children was officially prohibited in 1783 as first in the world at all schools
the great sejm convened by stanisław ii august in 1788 successfully adopted the 3 may constitution the first set of modern supreme national laws in europe however this document accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies generated strong opposition from the commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from catherine ii who determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the polish-lithuanian state russia was aided in achieving its goal when the targowica confederation an organisation of polish nobles appealed to the empress for help in may 1792 russian forces crossed the commonwealth's frontier thus beginning the polish-russian war
the defensive war fought by the poles ended prematurely when the king convinced of the futility of resistance capitulated and joined the targowica confederation the confederation then took over the government russia and prussia fearing the mere existence of a polish state arranged for and in 1793 executed the second partition of the commonwealth which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence eventually in 1795 following the failed kościuszko uprising the commonwealth was partitioned one last time by all three of its more powerful neighbours and with this effectively ceased to exist
poles rebelled several times against the partitioners particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century an unsuccessful attempt at defending poland's sovereignty took place in 1794 during the kościuszko uprising where a popular and distinguished general tadeusz kosciuszko who had served under washington in america led polish insurgents against numerically superior russian forces despite the victory at the battle of racławice his ultimate defeat ended poland's independent existence for 123 years in 1807 napoleon i of france temporarily recreated a polish state as a satellite duchy of warsaw but after the failed napoleonic wars poland was again split between the victorious allies at the congress of vienna of 1815 the eastern part was ruled by the russian tsar as a congress kingdom which had a very liberal constitution however the tsars reduced polish freedoms and russia annexed the country in virtually all but name thus in the latter half of the 19th century only austrian-ruled galicia and particularly the free city of kraków created good environment for free polish cultural life to flourish
throughout the period of the partitions political and cultural repression of the polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying russian prussian and austrian governments notable among these are the november uprising of 1830 and january uprising of 1863 both of which were attempts to free poland from the rule of tsarist russia the november uprising began on 29 november 1830 in warsaw when led by lieutenant piotr wysocki young non-commissioned officers at the imperial russian army's military academy in that city revolted they were joined by large segments of polish society and together forced warsaw's russian garrison to withdraw north of the city
over the course of the next seven months polish forces successfully defeated the russian armies of field marshal hans karl von diebitsch and a number of other russian commanders however finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers save distant france and the newborn united states and with prussia and austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories the poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure upon the surrender of warsaw to general ivan paskievich many polish troops feeling they could not go on withdrew into germany and there laid down their arms poles would have to wait another 32 years for another opportunity to free their homeland
when in january 1863 a new polish uprising against russian rule began it did so as a spontaneous protest by young poles against conscription into the imperial russian army however the insurrectionists despite being joined by high-ranking polish-lithuanian officers and numerous politicians were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support they were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the russian-controlled congress poland and poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement
despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs instituted by the occupying powers which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity this was particularly true in the greater poland pomerania and warmia annexed by prussia later becoming a part of the german empire an area which eventually thanks largely to the greater poland uprising was reconstituted as a part of the second polish republic and became one of its most productive regions
during world war i all the allies agreed on the reconstitution of poland that united states president woodrow wilson proclaimed in point 13 of his fourteen points a total of 2 million polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers and 450,000 died shortly after the armistice with germany in november 1918 poland regained its independence as the second polish republic ii rzeczpospolita polska it reaffirmed its independence after a series of military conflicts the most notable being the polish–soviet war 1919–1921 when poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the red army at the battle of warsaw an event which is considered to have halted the advance of communism into europe and forced vladimir lenin to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism nowadays the event is often referred to as the miracle at the vistula
during this period poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state railways were restructured to direct traffic towards warsaw instead of the former imperial capitals a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a major seaport was opened on the baltic coast so as to allow polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged free city of danzig
the inter-war period heralded in a new era of polish politics whilst polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the first world war the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition for this reason many exiled polish activists such as ignacy paderewski who would later become prime minister returned home to help a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures tragedy struck in 1922 when gabriel narutowicz inaugural holder of the presidency was assassinated at the zachęta gallery in warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist eligiusz niewiadomski
the 1926 may coup of józef piłsudski turned rule of the second polish republic over to the sanacja movement by the 1930s poland had become increasingly authoritarian a number of 'undesirable' political parties such as the polish communists had been banned and following piłsudski's death the regime unable to appoint a new leader began to show its inherent internal weaknesses and unwillingness to cooperate in any way with other political parties
as result of the munich agreement of 1 october 1938 poland invaded and occupied the zaolzie region of czechoslovakia
the formal beginning of world war ii was marked by the nazi german invasion of poland on 1 september 1939 followed by the soviet invasion of poland on 17 september in violation of the soviet–polish non-aggression pact on 28 september 1939 warsaw capitulated as agreed earlier in the molotov–ribbentrop pact poland was split into two occupied zones one subdivided by nazi germany while the other including all of eastern kresy fell under the control of the soviet union in 1939–1941 the soviets had deported hundreds of thousands of poles out to the most distant parts of the soviet union the soviet nkvd secretly executed thousands of polish prisoners of war inter alia katyn massacre ahead of the operation barbarossa german planners had in november 1939 called for the complete destruction of all poles and their fate as well as many other slavs was outlined in genocidal generalplan ost
all in all poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution to the allied war effort after the soviets the british and the americans polish troops fought under the command of both the polish government in exile in the theatre of war west of germany and under soviet leadership in the theatre of war east of germany the polish expeditionary corps which was controlled by the exiled pre-war government based in london played an important role in the italian and north african campaigns they are particularly well remembered for their conduct at the battle of monte cassino a conflict which culminated in the raising of a polish flag over the ruins of the mountain-top abbey by the 12th podolian uhlans the polish forces in the theatre of war east of germany were commanded by lieutenant general władysław anders who had received his command from prime minister of the exiled government władysław sikorski on the east of germany the soviet-backed polish 1st army distinguished itself in the battles for berlin and warsaw although its actions in support of the latter have often been criticized
polish servicemen were also active in the theatres of naval and air warfare during the battle of britain polish squadrons such as the no 303 kościuszko fighter squadron achieved considerable success and by the end of the war the exiled polish air forces could claim 769 confirmed kills meanwhile the polish navy was active in the protection of convoys in the north sea and atlantic ocean
in addition to the organised units of the 1st army and the forces in the nazi-occupied europe the domestic underground resistance movement the armia krajowa or home army fought to free poland from german occupation and establish an independent polish state the wartime resistance movement in poland was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war and encompassed an unusually broad range of clandestine activities which essentially functioned as an underground state complete with degree-awarding universities and a court system the resistance was however largely loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist poland for this reason in the summer of 1944 they initiated operation tempest of which the warsaw uprising that begun on 1 august 1944 was the best known operation the objective of the uprising was to drive the german occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against germany and the axis powers however secondary motives for the uprising sought to see warsaw liberated before the soviets could reach the capital so as to underscore polish sovereignty by empowering the polish underground state before the soviet-backed polish committee of national liberation could assume control however a lack of available allied military aid and stalin's reluctance to allow the 1st army to help their fellow countrymen take the city led to the uprising's failure and subsequent planned destruction of the city
during the war german forces under direct order from adolf hitler set up six major extermination camps all of which operated in the heart of poland they included the notorious treblinka and auschwitz killing grounds this allowed the germans to transport the condemned jews away from public eye in the third reich or across occupied europe and – under the guise of resettlement – murder them in the general government and in brand new warthegau among other annexed areas the nazi crimes against the polish nation claimed the lives of 2.7 to 2.9 million polish jews and 2.77 million ethnic poles including polish intelligentsia doctors lawyers nobility priests and numerous others since 3,5 million jews lived in pre-war poland jewish victims make up the largest percentage of all victims of the nazis' extermination program it is estimated that of pre-war poland's jewry approximately 90% were killed throughout the occupation many members of the armia krajowa supported by the polish government in exile and millions of ordinary poles – at great risk to themselves and their families – engaged in rescuing jews from the nazi germans grouped by nationality poles represent the largest number of people who rescued jews during the holocaust to date 6,394 poles have been awarded the title of righteous among the nations by the state of israel–more than any other nation some estimates put the number of poles involved in rescue efforts at up to 3 million and credit poles with sheltering up to 450,000 jews
at the war's conclusion in 1945 poland's borders were shifted westwards resulting in considerable territorial losses most of the polish inhabitants of kresy were expelled along the curzon line in accordance with stalin's agreements the western border was moved to the oder-neisse line as a result poland's territory was reduced by 20% or 77,500 square kilometres 29,900 sq mi the shift forced the migration of millions of other people most of whom were poles germans ukrainians and jews of all the countries involved in the war poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens: over 6 million perished – nearly one-fifth of poland's population — half of them polish jews over 90% of deaths were non-military in nature population numbers did not recover until the 1970s an estimated 600,000 soviet soldiers died in conquering poland from german rule
at the insistence of joseph stalin the yalta conference sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-communist coalition government in moscow which ignored the polish government-in-exile based in london a move which angered many poles who considered it a betrayal by the allies in 1944 stalin had made guarantees to churchill and roosevelt that he would maintain poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place however upon achieving victory in 1945 the elections organized by the occupying soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of 'legitimacy' for soviet hegemony over polish affairs the soviet union instituted a new communist government in poland analogous to much of the rest of the eastern bloc as elsewhere in communist europe the soviet occupation of poland met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the fifties
despite widespread objections the new polish government accepted the soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of poland in particular the cities of wilno and lwów and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of red army units on poland's territory military alignment within the warsaw pact throughout the cold war came about as a direct result of this change in poland's political culture and in the european scene came to characterise the full-fledged integration of poland into the brotherhood of communist nations
the people's republic of poland polska rzeczpospolita ludowa was officially proclaimed in 1952 in 1956 after the death of bolesław bierut the régime of władysław gomułka became temporarily more liberal freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms a similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under edward gierek but most of the time persecution of anti-communist opposition groups persisted despite this poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the soviet bloc
labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity solidarność which over time became a political force despite persecution and imposition of martial law in 1981 it eroded the dominance of the polish united workers' party and by 1989 had triumphed in poland's first partially free and democratic parliamentary elections since the end of the second world war lech wałęsa a solidarity candidate eventually won the presidency in 1990 the solidarity movement heralded the collapse of communist regimes and parties across europe
a shock therapy programme initiated by leszek balcerowicz in the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its socialist-style planned economy into a market economy as with other post-communist countries poland suffered slumps in social and economic standards but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 gdp levels which it achieved by 1995 largely thanks to its booming economy
most visibly there were numerous improvements in human rights such as the freedom of speech internet freedom no censorship civil liberties 1st class and political rights 1st class according to freedom house in 1991 poland became a member of the visegrád group and joined the north atlantic treaty organization nato alliance in 1999 along with the czech republic and hungary poles then voted to join the european union in a referendum in june 2003 with poland becoming a full member on 1 may 2004 poland joined the schengen area in 2007 as a result of which the country's borders with other member states of the european union have been dismantled allowing for full freedom of movement within most of the eu in contrast to this a section of poland's eastern border now comprises the external eu border with belarus russia and ukraine that border has become increasingly well protected and has led in part to the coining of the phrase 'fortress europe' in reference to the seeming 'impossibility' of gaining entry to the eu for citizens of the former soviet union
poland has been one of the most prominent voices of establishing a common european armed forces with poland's premier along with chancellor angela merkel and president françois hollande collectively also part of weimar triangle taking steps to negotiate such a deal in hope of drastically reducing dependence on nato and increasing readiness poland has already built several commands of a common battle group with hungary czech republic and slovakia with a total of 12,000 troops ready for deployment poland is seeking to build more battle groups with lithuania and ukraine these battle groups have vowed to serve under the european union and not nato eurosceptics criticize such moves as further unnecessary integration and a new major step towards a federalized european union under one government military integration is judged to be the most significant step after a monetary union
on 10 april 2010 the president of the republic of poland lech kaczyński along with 89 other high-ranking polish officials died in a plane crash near smolensk russia the president's party were on their way to attend an annual service of commemoration for the victims of the katyń massacre when the tragedy took place
in 2011 the presidency of the council of the european union responsible for the functioning of the council was awarded to poland the same year parliamentary elections took place to both the senate and the sejm they were won by the ruling civic platform poland joined european space agency in 2012 as well as organised the uefa euro 2012 along with ukraine in 2013 poland also became a member of the development assistance committee in 2014 the prime minister of poland donald tusk was elected president of the european council
poland's territory extends across several geographical regions between latitudes 49° and 55° n and longitudes 14° and 25° e in the north-west is the baltic seacoast which extends from the bay of pomerania to the gulf of gdańsk this coast is marked by several spits coastal lakes former bays that have been cut off from the sea and dunes the largely straight coastline is indented by the szczecin lagoon the bay of puck and the vistula lagoon the centre and parts of the north lie within the north european plain
rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising the four hilly districts of moraines and moraine-dammed lakes formed during and after the pleistocene ice age these lake districts are the pomeranian lake district the greater polish lake district the kashubian lake district and the masurian lake district the masurian lake district is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern poland the lake districts form part of the baltic ridge a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the baltic sea
south of the northern european lowlands lie the regions of lusatia silesia and masovia which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys farther south lies the polish mountain region including the sudetes the kraków-częstochowa upland the świętokrzyskie mountains and the carpathian mountains including the beskids the highest part of the carpathians is the tatra mountains along poland's southern border
the geological structure of poland has been shaped by the continental collision of europe and africa over the past 60 million years and more recently by the quaternary glaciations of northern europe both processes shaped the sudetes and the carpathian mountains the moraine landscape of northern poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or loam while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain loess the kraków-częstochowa upland the pieniny and the western tatras consist of limestone while the high tatras the beskids and the karkonosze are made up mainly of granite and basalts the polish jura chain is one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth

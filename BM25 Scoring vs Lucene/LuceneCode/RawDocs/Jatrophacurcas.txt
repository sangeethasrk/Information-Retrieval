jatropha curcas - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
jatropha curcas is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family euphorbiaceae that is native to the american tropics most likely mexico and central america it is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world becoming naturalized in some areas the specific epithet curcas was first used by portuguese doctor garcia de orta more than 400 years ago and is of uncertain origin common names include barbados nut purging nut physic nut or jcl abbreviation of jatropha curcas linnaeus
j curcas is a poisonous semi-evergreen shrub or small tree reaching a height of 6 m 20 ft it is resistant to a high degree of aridity allowing it to be grown in deserts
the seeds contain 27-40% oil average: 34.4% that can be processed to produce a high-quality biodiesel fuel usable in a standard diesel engine the seeds are also a source of the highly poisonous toxalbumin curcin or jatrophin


cultivation is uncomplicated jatropha curcas grows in tropical and subtropical regions the plant can grow in wastelands and grows on almost any terrain even on gravelly sandy and saline soils it can thrive in poor and stony soils although new research suggests that the plant's ability to adapt to these poor soils is not as extensive as had been previously stated complete germination is achieved within 9 days adding manure during the germination has negative effects during that phase but is favorable if applied after germination is achieved it can be propagated by cuttings which yields faster results than multiplication by seeds
the flowers only develop terminally at the end of a stem so a good ramification plants presenting many branches produces the greatest amount of fruits the plants are self-compatible another productivity factor is the ratio between female and male flowers within an inflorescence more female flowers mean more fruits jatropha curcas thrives on a mere 250 mm 10 in of rain a year and only during its first two years does it need to be watered in the closing days of the dry season ploughing and planting are not needed regularly as this shrub has a life expectancy of approximately forty years the use of pesticides is not necessary due to the pesticidal and fungicidal properties of the plant it is used in rural bengal for dhobi itch a common fungal infection of the skin
while jatropha curcas starts yielding from 9-12 months time the best yields are obtained only after 2–3 years time the seed production is around 3.5 tons per hectare seed production ranges from about 0.4 t ha in the first year to over 5 t ha after 3 years if planted in hedges the reported productivity of jatropha is from 0.8 to 1.0 kg of seed per meter of live fence
jatropha curcas has limited natural vegetative propagation and is usually propagated by seed propagation through seed sexual propagation leads to a lot of genetic variability in terms of growth biomass seed yield and oil content low seed viability and the recalcitrant nature of oil seeds also limit seed propagation however clonal techniques can help in overcoming these problems that hinder mass propagation of this tree-borne oilseed species vegetative propagation has been achieved by stem cuttings grafting budding as well as by air layering techniques the investigation leads to the recommendation that cuttings should be taken preferably from juvenile plants and treated with 200 micro gram per litre of iba rooting hormone to ensure the highest level of rooting in stem cuttings these vegetative methods have potential for commercial propagation of these plants

jatropha crude oil
seed extraction is made simple with the use of the universal nut sheller an appropriate technology designed by the full belly project
oil content varies from 28% to 30% and 80% extraction one hectare of plantation will give 400 to 600 litres of oil if the soil is average
the oily seeds are processed into oil which may be used directly straight vegetable oil to fuel combustion engines or may be subjected to transesterification to produce biodiesel jatropha oil is not suitable for human consumption as it induces strong vomiting and diarrhea
a colourant can also be derived from the seed
when jatropha seeds are crushed the resulting jatropha oil can be processed to produce a high-quality biofuel or biodiesel that can be used in a standard diesel car or further processed into jet fuel while the residue press cake can also be used as biomass feedstock to power electricity plants used as fertilizer it contains nitrogen phosphorus and potassium or as animal fodder the cake can also be used as feed in digesters and gasifiers to produce biogas
there are several forms of biofuel often manufactured using sedimentation centrifugation and filtration the fats and oils are turned into esters while separating the glycerin at the end of the process the glycerin settles and the biofuel floats the process through which the glycerin is separated from the biodiesel is known as transesterification glycerin is another by-product from jatropha oil processing that can add value to the crop transesterification is a simple chemical reaction that neutralizes the free fatty acids present in any fatty substances in jatropha a chemical exchange takes place between the alkoxy groups of an ester compound by an alcohol usually methanol and ethanol are used for the purpose the reaction occurs by the presence of a catalyst usually sodium hydroxide naoh or caustic soda and potassium hydroxide koh which forms fatty esters eg methyl or ethyl esters commonly known as biodiesel it takes approximately 10% of methyl alcohol by weight of the fatty substance to start the transesterification process
estimates of jatropha seed yield vary widely due to a lack of research data the genetic diversity of the crop the range of environments in which it is grown and jatropha's perennial life cycle seed yields under cultivation can range from 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms per hectare corresponding to extractable oil yields of 540 to 680 litres per hectare 58 to 73 us gallons per acre in 2009 time magazine cited the potential for as much as 1,600 gallons of diesel fuel per acre per year the plant may yield more than four times as much fuel per hectare as soybean and more than ten times that of maize corn but at the same time it requires five times as much water per unit of energy produced as does corn see below a hectare of jatropha has been claimed to produce 1,892 litres of fuel however as it has not yet been domesticated or improved by plant breeders yields are variable
jatropha can also be intercropped with other cash crops such as coffee sugar fruits and vegetables
in 2007 goldman sachs cited jatropha curcas as one of the best candidates for future biodiesel production however despite its abundance and use as an oil and reclamation plant none of the jatropha species has been properly domesticated and as a result its productivity is variable and the long-term impact of its large-scale use on soil quality and the environment is unknown
in 2008 researchers at daimler chrysler research explored the use of jatropha oil for automotive use concluding that although jatropha oil as fuel has not yet reached optimal quality  it already fulfills the eu norm for biodiesel quality archer daniels midland company bayer cropscience and daimler ag have a joint project to develop jatropha as a biofuel three mercedes cars powered by jatropha diesel have already put some 30,000 kilometres behind them the project is supported by daimlerchrysler and by the german association for investment and development deutschen investitions- und entwicklungsgesellschaft deg
aviation fuels may be more widely replaced by biofuels such as jatropha oil than fuels for other forms of transportation there are fewer planes than cars or trucks and far fewer jet fueling stations to convert than gas stations

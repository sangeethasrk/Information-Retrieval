methanol also known as methyl alcohol wood alcohol wood naphtha methyl hydrate or wood spirits is a chemical with the formula ch3oh often abbreviated meoh methanol acquired the name wood alcohol because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood today industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and hydrogen
methanol is the simplest alcohol being only a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group it is a light volatile colorless flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol drinking alcohol however unlike ethanol methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption at room temperature it is a polar liquid and is used as an antifreeze solvent fuel and as a denaturant for ethanol it is also used for producing biodiesel via transesterification reaction
methanol is produced naturally in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment as a result the atmosphere contains a small amount of methanol vapor but in only a few days atmospheric methanol is oxidized by sunlight to produce carbon dioxide and water
methanol is also found in abundant quantities in star forming regions of space and is used in astronomy as a marker for such regions it is detected through its spectral emission lines
methanol burns in oxygen including open air forming carbon dioxide and water:
methanol ingested in large quantities is metabolized first to formaldehyde and then to formic acid or formate salts which are poisonous to the central nervous system and may cause blindness coma and death because of these toxic properties methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses this addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol commonly known as denatured alcohol or methylated spirit from liquor excise taxation in the us and some other countries
methanol is poisonous to the central nervous system and may cause blindness coma and death however in small amounts methanol is a natural endogenous compound found in normal healthy human individuals a study found a mean of 4.5 ppm in the exhaled breath of subjects the mean endogenous methanol production in humans of 0.45 g d may be metabolized from pectin found in fruit one kilogram of apple produces up to 1.4 g methanol
methanol has a high toxicity in humans as little as 10 ml of pure methanol ingested is metabolized into formic acid which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve 30 ml is potentially fatal although the median lethal dose is typically 100 ml 3.4 fl oz ie 1–2 ml kg body weight of pure methanol reference dose for methanol is 2 mg kg day toxic effects begin hours after ingestion and antidotes can often prevent permanent damage because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol the alcohol in beverages it is difficult to differentiate between the two such is also the case with denatured alcohol however there are cases of methanol resistance such as that of mike malloy who was the victim of a failed murder attempt by methanol in the early 1930s
methanol is toxic by two mechanisms first methanol whether it enters the body by ingestion inhalation or absorption through the skin can be fatal due to its cns depressant properties in the same manner as ethanol poisoning second in a process of toxication it is metabolized to formic acid which is present as the formate ion via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase adh and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid formate via aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh the conversion to formate via aldh proceeds completely with no detectable formaldehyde remaining formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase causing hypoxia at the cellular level and metabolic acidosis among a variety of other metabolic disturbances
methanol poisoning can be treated with fomepizole or if unavailable ethanol both drugs act to reduce the action of alcohol dehydrogenase on methanol by means of competitive inhibition and the methanol is excreted by the kidneys rather than transformed into toxic metabolites additional treatment may include sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis and hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration to remove methanol and formate from the blood folinic acid or folic acid is also administered to enhance the metabolism of formate
the initial symptoms of methanol intoxication include central nervous system depression headache dizziness nausea lack of coordination and confusion sufficiently large doses cause unconsciousness and death the initial symptoms of methanol exposure are usually less severe than the symptoms from the ingestion of a similar quantity of ethanol once the initial symptoms have passed a second set of symptoms arises from 10 to as many as 30 hours after the initial exposure that may include blurring or complete loss of vision acidosis and putaminal hemorrhages an uncommon but serious complication these symptoms result from the accumulation of toxic levels of formate in the blood and may progress to death by respiratory failure physical examination may show tachypnea and ophthalmologic examination may show dilated pupils with hyperemia of the optic disc and retinal edema
ethanol is sometimes denatured adulterated and made poisonous by the addition of methanol the result is known as methylated spirit meths british use or metho australian slang this is not to be confused with meth a common abbreviation for methamphetamine and for methadone in britain
methanol is used primarily as a feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals and as a fuel for specialized vehicles as mentioned above it is a common de-naturing agent as a common laboratory solvent is especially useful for hplc uv vis spectroscopy and lcms due to its low uv cutoff
methanol is primarily used in making other chemicals about 40% of methanol is converted to formaldehyde and from there into products as diverse as plastics plywood paints explosives and permanent press textiles
in the early 1970s a process was developed by mobil for producing gasoline fuel for vehicles one such industrial facility was built at motunui in new zealand in the 1980s in the 1990s large amounts of methanol were used in the united states to produce the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether mtbe while mtbe is no longer marketed in the us it is still widely used in other parts of the world methanol or less commonly ethanol is a component in the transesterification of triglycerides for production of biodiesel
other chemical derivatives of methanol include dimethyl ether dme which has replaced chlorofluorocarbons as an aerosol spray propellant and acetic acid dimethyl ether can be blended with liquified petroleum gas lpg for home heating and cooking and can be used as a replacement for transportation diesel fuel
of high interest to the petrochemical marketplace methanol is an important ingredient in new and lower-cost methods for producing propylene which is much in demand such methods include methanol-to-olefins mto methanol-to-propylene mto mtp metathesis propane dehydrogenation pdh high severity fcc and olefins cracking
the market for proponyl became tight when the ethane prices fell in the usa with the exploration of shale gas reserves the low priced ethylene produced from this raw material has given chemical producers in north america a feedstock advantage such change has put naphtha-fed steam crackers at a disadvantageous position with many of them shutting down or revamping to use ethane as feedstock nevertheless the propylene output rates from ethane-fed crackers are negligible
methanol is occasionally used to fuel internal combustion engines pure methanol is required by rule to be used in champcars monster trucks usac sprint cars as well as midgets modifieds etc and other dirt track series such as world of outlaws and motorcycle speedway mainly because in the event of an accident methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke since the late 1940s methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control control line free flight airplanes cars and trucks such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction drag racers mud racers and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a top alcohol dragster and until the end of the 2006 season all vehicles in the indianapolis 500 had to run methanol as a fuel for mud racers methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power gasoline and nitrous oxide alone
one problem with high concentrations of methanol in fuel is that alcohols corrode some metals particularly aluminium methanol although a weak acid attacks the oxide coating that normally protects the aluminum from corrosion:
the resulting methoxide salts are soluble in methanol resulting in a clean aluminium surface which is readily oxidized by dissolved oxygen also the methanol can act as an oxidizer:
this reciprocal process effectively fuels corrosion until either the metal is eaten away or the concentration of ch3oh is negligible methanol's corrosivity has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors
organic methanol produced from wood or other organic materials bioalcohol has been suggested as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based hydrocarbons low levels of methanol can be used in existing vehicles with the addition of cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors
methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation the chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel
the european fuel quality directive allows up to 3% methanol with an equal amount of cosolvent to be blended with gasoline sold in europe china uses more than one billion gallons of methanol per year as a transportation fuel in low level blends for conventional vehicles and high level blends in vehicles designed for methanol fuels
in the us the open fuel standard act of 2011 was introduced in the us congress to encourage car manufacturers to build cars capable of using methanol gasoline or ethanol fuels the bill is being championed by the open fuel standard coalition
methanol is a traditional denaturant for ethanol the product being known as denatured alcohol or methylated spirit this was commonly used during the prohibition to discourage consumption of bootlegged liquor and ended up causing several deaths
methanol is used as a solvent and as an antifreeze in pipelines and windshield washer fluid
in some wastewater treatment plants a small amount of methanol is added to wastewater to provide a carbon food source for the denitrifying bacteria which convert nitrates to nitrogen gas and reduce the nitrification of sensitive aquifers
during world war ii methanol was used as a fuel in several german military rocket designs under the name m-stoff and in a roughly 50 50 mixture with hydrazine known as c-stoff
methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s
methanol is used as a destaining agent in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
direct-methanol fuel cells are unique in their low temperature atmospheric pressure operation allowing them to be miniaturized to an unprecedented degree this combined with the relatively easy and safe storage and handling of methanol may open the possibility of fuel cell-powered consumer electronics such as laptop computers and mobile phones
methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner so alcohol stoves are often very simple sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel this lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness similarly the alcohol can be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling as with the brand sterno
methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as water methanol injection
methanol is useful as an energy carrier because it is easier to store than hydrogen and burns cleaner than fossil fuels
methanol is readily biodegradable in both aerobic oxygen present and anaerobic oxygen absent environments methanol will not persist in the environment the half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days such as benzene at 10–730 days since methanol is miscible with water and biodegradable it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater surface water air or soil
pure methanol has been used in open wheel auto racing since the mid-1960s unlike petroleum fires methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water a methanol-based fire burns invisibly unlike gasoline which burns with a visible flame if a fire occurs on the track there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast approaching drivers but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression the decision to permanently switch to methanol in american indycar racing was a result of the devastating crash and explosion at the 1964 indianapolis 500 which killed drivers eddie sachs and dave macdonald in 2007 indycars switched from methanol to ethanol
carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol today the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper and zinc oxides supported on alumina as first used by ici in 1966 at 5–10 mpa 50–100 atm and 250 °c 482 °f the reaction is characterized by high selectivity >99.8%:
since the production of synthesis gas from methane produces three moles of hydrogen for every mole of carbon monoxide whereas the synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide one way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject carbon dioxide into the methanol synthesis reactor where it too reacts to form methanol according to the equation:
in terms of mechanism the process occurs via iniatial conversion of co into co2 which is then hydrogenated:
where the h2o byproduct is recycled via the water-gas shift reaction
this gives an overall reaction which is the same as listed above
the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol has long been sought as a route to methanol this route is effected by enzymes such as methane monooxygenases but commercial routes remain elusive because of the tendency for over-oxidation ie methanol is more readily oxidized than is methane
originally synthesis gas for the production of methanol came from coal today synthesis gas is most commonly produced from the methane component in natural gas because natural gas contains hydrogen three processes are commercially practiced at moderate pressures of 4 mpa 40 atm and high temperatures around 850 °c methane reacts with steam on a nickel catalyst to produce syngas according to the chemical equation:
this reaction commonly called steam-methane reforming or smr is endothermic and the heat transfer limitations place limits on the size of and pressure in the catalytic reactors used methane can also undergo partial oxidation with molecular oxygen at atmospheric pressure to produce syngas as the following equation shows:
this reaction is exothermic and the heat given off can be used in-situ to drive the steam-methane reforming reaction when the two processes are combined it is referred to as autothermal reforming the high pressures and high temperatures needed for steam-reforming require a greater capital investment in equipment than is needed for a simple partial-oxidation process however the energy-efficiency of steam-reforming is higher than for partial-oxidation unless the waste-heat from partial-oxidation is used

energy audit - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
an energy audit is an inspection survey and analysis of energy flows for energy conservation in a building process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the outputs in commercial and industrial real estate an energy audit is the first step in identifying opportunities to reduce energy expense and carbon footprints


when the object of study is an occupied building then reducing energy consumption while maintaining or improving human comfort health and safety are of primary concern beyond simply identifying the sources of energy use an energy audit seeks to prioritize the energy uses according to the greatest to least cost effective opportunities for energy savings
a home energy audit is a service where the energy efficiency of a house is evaluated by a person using professional equipment such as blower doors and infrared cameras with the aim to suggest the best ways to improve energy efficiency in heating and cooling the house
an energy audit of a home may involve recording various characteristics of the building envelope including the walls ceilings floors doors windows and skylights for each of these components the area and resistance to heat flow r-value is measured or estimated the leakage rate or infiltration of air through the building envelope is of concern both of which are strongly affected by window construction and quality of door seals such as weatherstripping the goal of this exercise is to quantify the building's overall thermal performance the audit may also assess the efficiency physical condition and programming of mechanical systems such as the heating ventilation air conditioning equipment and thermostat
a home energy audit may include a written report estimating energy use given local climate criteria thermostat settings roof overhang and solar orientation this could show energy use for a given time period say a year and the impact of any suggested improvements per year the accuracy of energy estimates are greatly improved when the homeowner's billing history is available showing the quantities of electricity natural gas fuel oil or other energy sources consumed over a one or two-year period
some of the greatest effects on energy use are user behavior climate and age of the home an energy audit may therefore include an interview of the homeowners to understand their patterns of use over time the energy billing history from the local utility company can be calibrated using heating degree day and cooling degree day data obtained from recent local weather data in combination with the thermal energy model of the building advances in computer-based thermal modeling can take into account many variables affecting energy use
a home energy audit is often used to identify cost effective ways to improve the comfort and efficiency of buildings in addition homes may qualify for energy efficiency grants from central government
recently the improvement of smartphone technology has enabled homeowners to perform relatively sophisticated energy audits of their own homes this technique has been identified as a method to accelerate energy efficiency improvements
in the united states this kind of service can often be facilitated by:
utility companies may provide this service as well as loans and other incentives to insulate they also often provide incentives to switch for example if you are an oil customer considering switching to natural gas
where to look for insulation recommendations:
residential energy auditors are accredited by the building performance institute bpi or the residential energy services network resnet
there are also some simplified tools available with which a homeowner can quickly assess energy improvement potential often these are supplied for free by state agencies or local utilities who produce a report with estimates of usage by device area since they have usage information already examples include the energy trust of oregon program and the seattle home resource profile such programs may also include free compact fluorescent lights
a simple do-it-yourself home energy audit can be performed without using any specialized tools with an attentive and planned assessment a homeowner can spot many problems that cause energy losses and make decisions about possible energy efficiency upgrades during a home energy audit it is important to have a checklist of areas that were inspected as well as problems identified once the audit is completed a plan for suggested actions needs to be developed
in new york city some local laws such as local law 87 require buildings larger than 50,000 sq ft to have an energy audit once every 10 years as assigned by bbl number while the new laws require energy auditors to have certifications to perform this work there currently does not exist oversight to ensure that this is the case because local law 87 requires a licensed professional engineer to oversee the work choosing a well established engineering firm is the safest route these laws are the results of new york city's planyc to reduce energy used by buildings –– which are the greatest source of pollution in nyc some engineering firms provide free energy audits for facilities committed to implementing the energy saving measures found
since 2002 the lebanese center for energy conservation lcec initiated a nationwide program on energy audits for medium and large consuming facilities by the end of 2008 lcec has financed and supervised more than 100 audits
lcec launched an energy audit program to assist lebanese energy consuming tertiary and public buildings and industrial plants in the management of their energy through this program
the long term objective of lcec is to create a market for escos whereby any beneficiary can contact directly a specialized esco to conduct an energy audit implement energy conservation measures and monitor energy saving program according to a standardized energy performance contract
currently lcec is helping in the funding of the energy audit study and thus is linking both the beneficiary and the energy audit firm lcec also targets the creation of a special fund used for the implementation of the energy conservation measures resulting from the study
lcec set a minimum standard for the escos qualifications in lebanon and published a list of qualified escos on its website
increasingly in the last several decades industrial energy audits have exploded as the demand to lower increasingly expensive energy costs and move towards a sustainable future have made energy audits greatly important their importance is magnified since energy spending is a major expense to industrial companies energy spending accounts for ~ 10% of the average manufacturer's expenses this growing trend should only continue as energy costs continue to rise
while the overall concept is similar to a home or residential energy audit industrial energy audits require a different skillset weatherproofing and insulating a house are the main focus of residential energy audits for industrial applications it is the hvac lighting and production equipment that use the most energy and hence are the primary focus of energy audits
the term energy audit is commonly used to describe a broad spectrum of energy studies ranging from a quick walk-through of a facility to identify major problem areas to a comprehensive analysis of the implications of alternative energy efficiency measures sufficient to satisfy the financial criteria of sophisticated investors numerous audit procedures have been developed for non-residential tertiary buildings ashrae iea-ebc annex 11 krarti 2000 audit is required to identify the most efficient and cost-effective energy conservation opportunities ecos or measures ecms energy conservation opportunities or measures can consist in more efficient use or of partial or global replacement of the existing installation
when looking to the existing audit methodologies developed in iea ebc annex 11 by ashrae and by krarti 2000 it appears that the main issues of an audit process are:
common types levels of energy audits are distinguished below although

thermal efficiency - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
in thermodynamics the thermal efficiency  is a dimensionless performance measure of a device that uses thermal energy such as an internal combustion engine a steam turbine or a steam engine a boiler a furnace or a refrigerator for example for a power cycle thermal efficiency indicates the extent to which the energy added by heat is converted to net work output in the case of a refrigeration or heat pump cycle thermal efficiency indicates the extent to which the energy added by work is converted to net heat output


in general energy conversion efficiency is the ratio between the useful output of a device and the input in energy terms for thermal efficiency the input  to the device is heat or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed the desired output is mechanical work  or heat  or possibly both because the input heat normally has a real financial cost a memorable generic definition of thermal efficiency is
from the first law of thermodynamics the energy output cannot exceed the input so
when expressed as a percentage the thermal efficiency must be between 0% and 100% efficiency is typically less than 100% because there are inefficiencies such as friction and heat loss that convert the energy into alternative forms for example a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25% efficiency and a large coal-fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46% the largest diesel engine in the world peaks at 51.7% in a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching 60% such a real-world value may be used as a figure of merit for the device
for engines where a fuel is burned there are two types of thermal efficiency: indicated thermal efficiency and brake thermal efficiency this efficiency is only appropriate when comparing similar types or similar devices
for other systems the specifics of the calculations of efficiency vary but the non dimensional input is still the same efficiency = output energy   input energy
heat engines transform thermal energy or heat qin into mechanical energy or work wout they cannot do this task perfectly so some of the input heat energy is not converted into work but is dissipated as waste heat qout into the environment
the thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of heat energy that is transformed into work thermal efficiency is defined as
the efficiency of even the best heat engines is low usually below 50% and often far below so the energy lost to the environment by heat engines is a major waste of energy resources since a large fraction of the fuels produced worldwide go to powering heat engines perhaps up to half of the useful energy produced worldwide is wasted in engine inefficiency although modern cogeneration combined cycle and energy recycling schemes are beginning to use this heat for other purposes this inefficiency can be attributed to three causes there is an overall theoretical limit to the efficiency of any heat engine due to temperature called the carnot efficiency second specific types of engines have lower limits on their efficiency due to the inherent irreversibility of the engine cycle they use thirdly the nonideal behavior of real engines such as mechanical friction and losses in the combustion process causes further efficiency losses
the second law of thermodynamics puts a fundamental limit on the thermal efficiency of all heat engines even an ideal frictionless engine can't convert anywhere near 100% of its input heat into work the limiting factors are the temperature at which the heat enters the engine  and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat  measured in an absolute scale such as the kelvin or rankine scale from carnot's theorem for any engine working between these two temperatures:
this limiting value is called the carnot cycle efficiency because it is the efficiency of an unattainable ideal reversible engine cycle called the carnot cycle no device converting heat into mechanical energy regardless of its construction can exceed this efficiency
examples of are the temperature of hot steam entering the turbine of a steam power plant or the temperature at which the fuel burns in an internal combustion engine is usually the ambient temperature where the engine is located or the temperature of a lake or river that waste heat is discharged into for example if an automobile engine burns gasoline at a temperature of and the ambient temperature is  then its maximum possible efficiency is:
it can be seen that since is fixed by the environment the only way for a designer to increase the carnot efficiency of an engine is to increase  the temperature at which the heat is added to the engine the efficiency of ordinary heat engines also generally increases with operating temperature and advanced structural materials that allow engines to operate at higher temperatures is an active area of research
due to the other causes detailed below practical engines have efficiencies far below the carnot limit for example the average automobile engine is less than 35% efficient
carnot's theorem applies to thermodynamic cycles where thermal energy is converted to mechanical work devices that convert a fuel's chemical energy directly into electrical work such as fuel cells can exceed the carnot efficiency
the carnot cycle is reversible and thus represents the upper limit on efficiency of an engine cycle practical engine cycles are irreversible and thus have inherently lower efficiency than the carnot efficiency when operated between the same temperatures and  one of the factors determining efficiency is how heat is added to the working fluid in the cycle and how it is removed the carnot cycle achieves maximum efficiency because all the heat is added to the working fluid at the maximum temperature  and removed at the minimum temperature  in contrast in an internal combustion engine the temperature of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder is nowhere near its peak temperature as the fuel starts to burn and only reaches the peak temperature as all the fuel is consumed so the average temperature at which heat is added is lower reducing efficiency
an important parameter in the efficiency of combustion engines is the specific heat ratio of the air-fuel mixture Î³ this varies somewhat with the fuel but is generally close to the air value of 1.4 this standard value is usually used in the engine cycle equations below and when this approximation is made the cycle is called an air-standard cycle
the above efficiency formulas are based on simple idealized mathematical models of engines with no friction and working fluids that obey simple thermodynamic rules called the ideal gas law real engines have many departures from ideal behavior that waste energy reducing actual efficiencies far below the theoretical values given above examples are:
another source of inefficiency is that engines must be optimized for other goals besides efficiency such as low pollution the requirements for vehicle engines are particularly stringent: they must be designed for low emissions adequate acceleration fast starting light weight low noise etc these require compromises in design such as altered valve timing to reduce emissions that reduce efficiency the average automobile engine is only about 35% efficient and must also be kept idling at stoplights wasting an additional 17% of the energy resulting in an overall efficiency of 18% large stationary electric generating plants have fewer of these competing requirements as well as more efficient rankine cycles so they are significantly more efficient than vehicle engines around 50% therefore replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles which run on a battery that is charged with electricity generated by burning fuel in a power plant has the theoretical potential to increase the thermal efficiency of energy use in transportation thus decreasing the demand for fossil fuels
when comparing different heat engines as sources of power such as electric power or the power to run vehicles the engine efficiency alone is only one factor to give a meaningful comparison th

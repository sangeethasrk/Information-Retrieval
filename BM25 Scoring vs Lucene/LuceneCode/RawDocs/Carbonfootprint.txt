carbon footprint - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
a carbon footprint is historically defined as the total set of greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual event organisation product expressed as co2e
the total carbon footprint cannot be calculated because of the large amount of data required and the fact that carbon dioxide can be produced by natural occurrences it is for this reason that wright kemp and williams writing in the journal carbon management have suggested a more practicable definition:
greenhouse gases ghgs can be emitted through transport land clearance and the production and consumption of food fuels manufactured goods materials wood roads buildings and services for simplicity of reporting it is often expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent of other ghgs emitted
most of the carbon footprint emissions for the average us household come from indirect sources ie fuel burned to produce goods far away from the final consumer these are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel directly in one's car or stove commonly referred to as direct sources of the consumer's carbon footprint
the concept name of the carbon footprint originates from ecological footprint discussion which was developed by rees and wackernagel in the 1990s which estimates the number of earths that would theoretically be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint however given that ecological footprints are a measure of failure anindita mitra crea seattle chose the more easily calculated carbon footprint to easily measure use of carbon as an indicator of unsustainable energy use in 2007 carbon footprints was used as a measure of carbon emissions to develop the energy plan for city of lynnwood washington carbon footprints are much more specific than ecological footprints since they measure direct emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere
carbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators which also includes water footprint and land footprint


an individual's nation's or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a ghg emissions assessment or other calculative activities denoted as carbon accounting once the size of a carbon footprint is known a strategy can be devised to reduce it eg by technological developments better process and product management changed green public or private procurement gpp carbon capture consumption strategies carbon offsetting and others
several free online carbon footprint calculators exist including a few supported by publicly available peer-reviewed data and calculations including the university of california berkeley's coolclimate network research consortium and carbonstory these websites ask you to answer more or less detailed questions about your diet transportation choices home size shopping and recreational activities usage of electricity heating and heavy appliances such as dryers and refrigerators and so on the website then estimates your carbon footprint based on your answers to these questions a systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individual household carbon footprints this review identified 13 calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the 15 most popular online carbon footprint calculators the research documented significant shortcomings of a majority of the calculators
the mitigation of carbon footprints through the development of alternative projects such as solar or wind energy or reforestation represents one way of reducing a carbon footprint and is often known as carbon offsetting
the main influences on carbon footprints include population economic output and energy and carbon intensity of the economy these factors are the main targets of individuals and businesses in order to decrease carbon footprints scholars suggest the most effective way to decrease a carbon footprint is to either decrease the amount of energy needed for production or to decrease the dependence on carbon emitting fuels
the average carbon footprint in the united states vs world the average us household carbon footprint is about 50 tons co2e per year the single largest source of emissions for the typical household is from driving gasoline use transportation as a whole driving flying & small amount from public transit is the largest overall category followed by housing electricity natural gas waste construction then food mostly from red meat dairy and seafood products but also includes emissions from all other food then goods followed lastly by services the carbon footprint of us households is about 5 times greater than the global average which is approximately 10 tons co2e per household per year for most us households the single most important action to reduce their carbon footprint is driving less or switching to a more efficient vehicle
the following table compares from peer-reviewed studies of full life cycle emissions and from various other studies the carbon footprint of various forms of energy generation: nuclear hydro coal gas solar cell peat and wind generation technology

note: 3.6 mj = megajoules == 1 kw·h = kilowatt-hours thus 1 g mj = 3.6 g kw·h legend: b = black coal supercritical–new subcritical br = brown coal new subcritical cc = combined cycle oc = open cycle tl = low-temperature closed-circuit geothermal doublet th = high-temperature open-circuit wl = light water reactors wh = heavy water reactors #educated estimate
these three studies thus concluded that hydroelectric wind and nuclear power produced the least co2 per kilowatt-hour of any other electricity sources these figures do not allow for emissions due to accidents or terrorism wind power and solar power emit no carbon from the operation but do leave a footprint during construction phase and maintenance during operation hydropower from reservoirs also has large footprints from initial removal of vegetation and ongoing methane stream detritus decays anaerobically to methane in bottom of reservoir rather than aerobically to co2 if it had stayed in an unrestricted stream
the table above gives the carbon footprint per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated which is about half the world's man-made co2 output the co2 footprint for heat is equally significant and research shows that using waste heat from power generation in combined heat and power district heating chp dh has the lowest carbon footprint much lower than micro-power or heat pumps
this section gives representative figures for the carbon footprint of the fuel burned by different transport types not including the carbon footprints of the vehicles or related infrastructure themselves the precise figures vary according to a wide range of factors
some representative figures for co2 emissions are provided by lipasto's survey of average direct emissions not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects of airliners expressed as co2 and co2 equivalent per passenger kilometre:
co2 emissions per passenger kilometre pkm for all road travel for 2011 in europe as provided by the european environment agency:
for vehicles average figures for co2 emissions per kilometre for road travel for 2013 in europe normalized to the nedc test cycle are provided by the international council on clean transportation:
average figures for the united states are provided by the us environmental protection agency based on the epa federal test procedure for the following categories:
in 2005 the us company amtrak's carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per passenger kilometre were 0.116 kg about twice as high as the uk rail average where much more of the system is electrified and about eight times a finnish electric intercity train
average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passenger-kilometre seem to be 0.12 kg 4.2 oz however 18-knot ferries between finland and sweden produce 0.221 kg 7.8 oz of co2 with total emissions equalling a co2 equivalent of 0.223 kg 7.9 oz while 24–27-knot ferries between finland and estonia produce 0.396 kg 14.0 oz of co2 with total emissions equalling a co2 equivalent of 0.4 kg 14 oz
several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products the us environmental protection agency has addressed paper plastic candy wrappers glass cans computers carpet and tires australia has addressed lumber and other building materials academics in australia korea and the us have addressed paved roads companies nonprofits and academics have addressed mailing letters and packages carnegie mellon university has estimated the co2 footprints of 46 large sectors of the economy in each of eight countries carnegie mellon sweden and the carbon trust have addressed foods at home and in restaurants
the carbon trust has worked with uk manufacturers on foods shirts and detergents introducing a co2 label in march 2007 the label is intended to comply with a new british publicly available specification ie not a standard pas 2050 and is being actively piloted by the carbon trust and various industrial partners as of august 2012 the carbon trust state they have measured 27,000 certifiable product carbon footprints
evaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint the key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item for example a juice carton is made of an aseptic carton a beer can is made of aluminum and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic the larger the size the larger the footprint will be
in a 2014 study by scarborough et al the real-life diets of british people were surveyed and their dietary greenhouse gas footprints estimated average dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent were:
the precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors however studies of textile production in europe suggest the following carbon dioxide equivalent emissions footprints per kilo of texile at the point of purchase by a consumer:
accounting for durability and energy required to wash and dry textile products synthetic fabrics generally have a substantially lower carbon footprint than natural ones
the carbon footprint of materials also known as embodied carbon varies widely the carbon footprint of many common materials can be found in the inventory of carbon & energy database and lca databases via openlca nexus
cement production and carbon footprint resulting from soil sealing was 8.0 mg person of total per capita co2 emissions italy year 2003 the balance between c loss due to soil sealing and c stocked in man-made infrastructures resulted in a net loss to the atmosphere -0.6 mg c ha y
carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and the emissions of other ghgs are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels like natural gas crude oil and coal while this is harmful to the environment carbon offsets can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects
the kyoto protocol defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the ghg emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the kyoto protocol accordingly from an economic or market perspective one has to distinguish between a mandatory market and a voluntary market typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:
to reach the goals defined in the kyoto protocol with the least economical costs the following flexible mechanisms were introduced for the mandatory market:
the cdm and ji mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments while emissions trading allows those instruments to be sold on international markets
- projects which are compliant with the requirements of the cdm mechanism generate certified emissions reductions cers - projects which are compliant with the requirements of the ji mechanism generate emission reduction units erus
the cers and erus can then be sold through emissions trading the demand for the cers and erus being traded is driven by:
- shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the kyoto protocol - shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes
nations which have failed to deliver their kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter emissions trading to purchase cers and erus to cover their treaty shortfalls nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries if the rules of a scheme allow the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing cers and erus through emissions trading while local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the kyoto protocol itself they play a prominent role in creating the demand for cers and erus stimulating emissions trading and setting a market price for emissions
a well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the eu emissions trading scheme eu ets
new changes are being made to the trading schemes the eu emissions trading scheme is set to make some new changes within the next year the new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the european union
other nations are scheduled to start participating in emissions trading schemes within the next few year these nations include china india and the united states
in contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions a solution comparable with those developed for the mandatory market has been developed for the voluntary market the verified emission reductions ver this measure has the great advantage that the projects activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for cdm ji projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the executive board of the uno as such high quality vers can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality however at present vers can not be used in the mandatory market
the voluntary market in north america is divided between members of the chicago climate exchange and the over the counter otc market the chicago climate exchange is a voluntary yet legally binding cap-and-trade emission scheme whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions the otc market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres as well as special events that want to go carbon neutral being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference
there are project developers wholesalers brokers and retailers as well as carbon funds in the voluntary market some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above a report by ecosystem marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain—from project developer to retailer
while some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects these projects flourish in the voluntary markets a major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of ghg sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects however others note the community co-benefits that forestry projects foster project types in the voluntary market range from avoided deforestation afforestation reforestation industrial gas sequestration increased energy efficiency fuel switching methane capture from coal plants and livestock and even renewable energy renewable energy certificates recs sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to additionality concerns industrial gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs siphoning off industrial gas f

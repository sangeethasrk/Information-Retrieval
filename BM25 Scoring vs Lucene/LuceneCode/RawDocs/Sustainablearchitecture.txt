sustainable architecture - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
sustainable architecture is architecture that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings by efficiency and moderation in the use of materials energy and development space sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment
the idea of sustainability or ecological design is to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations


energy efficiency over the entire life cycle of a building is the most important goal of sustainable architecture architects use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy one of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of site analysis
numerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning
an important and cost-effective element of an efficient heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac system is a well-insulated building a more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power but may require more ventilation capacity to expel polluted indoor air
significant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water air and compost streams off the shelf on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture energy from waste hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized anaerobic digesters
hvac systems are powered by motors copper versus other metal conductors helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components for main article see: copper in energy-efficient motors
site and building orientation have some major effects on a building's hvac efficiency
passive solar building design allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any active solar mechanisms such as photovoltaic cells or solar hot water panels typically passive solar building designs incorporate materials with high thermal mass that retain heat effectively and strong insulation that works to prevent heat escape low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading by means of awnings blinds or shutters to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling in addition low energy buildings typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss this means that sprawling multi-winged building designs often thought to look more organic are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures traditional cold climate buildings such as american colonial saltbox designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building
windows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass a poor insulator in the northern hemisphere this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows certain window types such as double or triple glazed insulated windows with gas filled spaces and low emissivity low-e coatings provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs deciduous trees are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter when the sun is lower in the sky and keep it out in the summer when the sun is high in the sky coniferous or evergreen plants are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds
in colder climates heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings
in warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern passive solar designs can also be very effective masonry building materials with high thermal mass are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day in addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby bodies of water many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the traditional architecture of warm regions such as south-western mission buildings
in climates with four seasons an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated when it is sited to work with the forces of nature when heat is recaptured to be used immediately or stored when the heat plant relying on fossil fuels or electricity is greater than 100% efficient and when renewable energy is used
active solar devices such as photovoltaic solar panels help to provide sustainable electricity for any use electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation efficiency latitude and climate—solar gain varies even at the same latitude typical efficiencies for commercially available pv panels range from 4% to 28% the low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation this low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative in germany for example solar panels are commonly installed in residential home construction
roofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency in the northern hemisphere a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels if true-south is not possible solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within 30° of south however at higher latitudes winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation
to maximize efficiency in winter the collector can be angled above horizontal latitude +15° to maximize efficiency in summer the angle should be latitude -15° however for an annual maximum production the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude
the use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors in considering costs small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce for small wind turbines maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities at low-wind sites maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine's revenue wind turbines begin operating when winds reach 8 mph achieve energy production capacity at speeds of 32-37 mph and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding 55 mph the energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building because of these factors the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site for these reasons for wind turbines to be at all efficient they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind with average wind speeds of more than 15 mph rather than locations that receive wind sporadically a small wind turbine can be installed on a roof installation issues then include the strength of the roof vibration and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from 10% to up to 25% of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling turbines for residential scale use are usually between 7 feet 2 m to 25 feet 8 m in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of 900 watts to 10,000 watts at their tested wind speed building integrated wind turbine performance can be enhanced with the addition of an aerofoil wing on top of a roof mounted turbine
solar water heaters also called solar domestic hot water systems can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home they can be used in any climate and the fuel they use—sunshine—is free
there are two types of solar water systems- active and passive an active solar collector system can produce about 80 to 100 gallons of hot water per day a passive system will have a lower capacity
there are also two types of circulation direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels they should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water
the two most common types of collector panels are flat-plate and evacuated-tube the two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat which greatly improves their efficiency 5%-25% more efficient with these higher efficiencies evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems
electric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around 4500 kw·h year with the use of solar collectors the energy use is cut in half the up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high but with the annual energy savings payback periods are relatively short
air-source heat pumps ashp can be thought of as reversible air conditioners like an air conditioner an ashp can take heat from a relatively cool space eg a house at 70 °f and dump it into a hot place eg outside at 85 °f however unlike an air conditioner the condenser and evaporator of an ashp can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house
air-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems however the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot therefore they are only really applicable in temperate climates
for areas not located in temperate climates ground-source or geothermal heat pumps provide an efficient alternative the difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground—usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant mild temperatures underground which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump the in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot
energy star ground-source heat pumps can be 40% to 60% more efficient than their air-source counterparts they are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating
in terms of initial cost the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed however the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs the reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters
other types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth if the building is located near a body of water the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink air-earth heat pumps circulate the building's air through underground ducts with higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction
some examples of sustainable building materials include recycled denim or blown-in fiber glass insulation sustainably harvested wood trass linoleum sheep wool concrete high and ultra high performance roman self-healing concrete panels made from paper flakes baked earth rammed earth clay vermiculite flax linnen sisal seegrass expanded clay grains coconut wood fibre plates calcium sand stone locally obtained stone and rock and bamboo which is one of the strongest and fastest growing woody plants and non-toxic low-voc glues and paints
sustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials such as reclaimed lumber and recycled copper the reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in embodied energy energy used in the production of materials often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate when older buildings are demolished frequently any good wood is reclaimed renewed and sold as flooring any good dimension stone is similarly reclaimed many other parts are reused as well such as doors windows mantels and hardware thus reducing the consumption of new goods when new materials are employed green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished such as bamboo which can be harvested for commercial use after only 6 years of growth sorghum or wheat straw both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels or cork oak in which only the outer bark is removed for use thus preserving the tree when possible building materials may be gleaned from the site itself for example if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself
low-impact building materials are used wherever feasible: for example insulation may be made from low voc volatile organic compound-emitting materials such as recycled denim or cellulose insulation rather than the building insulation materials that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde to discourage insect damage these alternate insulation materials may be treated with boric acid organic or milk-based paints may be used however a common fallacy is that green materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment many harmful substances including formaldehyde arsenic and asbestos are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions a study of emissions from materials by the state of california has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more traditional materials actually were lower emitters thus the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the earth
volatile organic compounds voc can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources vocs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility and are suspected of causing sick building syndrome type symptoms this is because many vocs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome indoor concentrations of vocs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere and when there are many vocs present they can cause additive and multiplicative effects
green products are usually considered to contain fewer vocs and be better for human and environmental health a case study conducted by the department of civil architectural and environmental engineering at the university of miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of vocs the amount and intensity of the vocs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human

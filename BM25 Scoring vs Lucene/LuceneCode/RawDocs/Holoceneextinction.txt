holocene extinction - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the holocene extinction otherwise referred to as the sixth extinction or anthropocene extinction is a name for the ongoing extinction event of species during the present holocene epoch since around 10,000 bce mainly due to human activity the large number of extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals including mammals birds amphibians reptiles and arthropods although 875 extinctions occurring between 1500 and 2009 have been documented by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources with widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforest as well as other areas the vast majority are thought to be undocumented according to the species-area theory and based on upper-bound estimating the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year making it the greatest loss of biodiversity since the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event
the holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna starting between 9,000 and 13,000 years ago the end of the last ice age megafauna outside of the african continent that did not evolve alongside humans proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the earth additionally many african species have also gone extinct in the holocene the extinction of the mammoths whose habits had maintained grasslands became birch forests without them the new forest and the resulting forest fires may have induced climate change such disappearances might be the result of the proliferation of modern humans these extinctions occurring near the pleistocene–holocene boundary are sometimes referred to as the quaternary extinction event
there is no general agreement on where the holocene or anthropogenic extinction begins and the quaternary extinction event which includes climate change resulting in the end of the last ice age ends or if they should be considered separate events at all some have suggested that anthropogenic extinctions may have begun as early as when the first modern humans spread out of africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago which is supported by rapid megafaunal extinction following recent human colonisation in australia new zealand and madagascar in a similar way that any large adaptable predator moving into a new ecosystem would in many cases it is suggested even minimal hunting pressure was enough to wipe out large fauna particularly on geographically isolated islands only during the most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses
the ecology of homo sapiens has been noted as being that of an unprecedented 'global superpredator' that regularly preys on the adults of other apex predators and has worldwide effects on food webs extinctions of species have occurred on every land mass and ocean with many famous examples within africa asia europe australia north and south america and on smaller islands overall the holocene extinction can be characterized by the human impact on the environment the holocene extinction continues into the 21st century with overfishing ocean acidification and the amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal cosmopolitan decline of biodiversity
it has been suggested human activity has made the period following the mid-20th century different enough from the holocene to consider it a new geological epoch known as the anthropocene which will be considered for implementation into the timeline of earth's history by the international commission on stratigraphy in 2016


extinction of animals plants and other organisms caused by human actions may go as far back as the late pleistocene over 12,000 years ago there is evidence that abrupt climate change has especially played an enormous role in the extinction of larger mammals however while previous mass extinctions were due to natural environmental causes research shows that wherever on earth humans have migrated other species have gone extinct and human population growth most prominently in the past two centuries is regarded as one of the underlying causes of extinction in terms of how humans have contributed three major factors include the increased global concentration of greenhouse gases affecting the global climate oceanic devastation such as through overfishing and contamination and the modification and destruction of vast tracts of land and river systems around the world to meet solely human-centered ends with 10 to 15 percent of earth's land surface now used as urban-industrial or row-crop agricultural sites and 6 to 8 percent used as pastures thus ruining the local ecosystems other related human causes of the extinction event include deforestation hunting pollution the introduction in various regions of non-native species and the widespread transmission of infectious diseases at present the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than the base or historically typical rate of extinction in terms of the natural evolution of the planet and also the current rate of extinction is therefore 10 to 100 times higher than any of the previous mass extinctions in the history of earth it is also the only known mass extinction of plants
the abundance of species extinctions considered anthropogenic or due to human activity have sometimes especially when referring to hypothesized future events been collectively called the anthropocene extinction the anthropocene is a term introduced in 2000 it is now widely accepted that a new geological epoch has begun characterised by the most abrupt and widespread extinction of species since the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago in the future of life 2002 eo wilson of harvard calculated that if the current rate of human disruption of the biosphere continues one-half of earth's higher lifeforms will be extinct by 2100 a 1998 poll conducted by the american museum of natural history found that seventy percent of biologists believe that we are in the midst of an anthropogenic extinction numerous scientific studies—such as a 2004 report published in nature and papers authored by the 10,000 scientists who contribute to the iucn's annual red list of threatened species—have since reinforced this conviction
the evidence of all previous extinctions is geological in nature and shorter geological time scale is of the order of several hundred thousand to several million years even extinctions caused by instantaneous events such as the impact of the asteroid in chicxulub which is currently the best example extend the equivalent of many human lives due to complex ecological interactions that were triggered by the event
recent extinctions described are well-documented but the nomenclature used varies the term anthropocene is a term that is used by few scientists and some commentators may refer to the current and projected future extinctions as part of a longer holocene extinction the holocene–anthropocene boundary is contested with some commentators asserting significant human influence on climate for much of what is normally regarded as the holocene epoch other commentators place the holocene–anthropocene boundary at the industrial revolution while also saying that formal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility particularly to earth scientists working on late holocene successions
three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extinction of megafauna in the late pleistocene of these only two have much scientific credibility although ross mcphee proposed that a hyper-disease may have been the cause of the extinction a study by lyons et al demonstrated conclusively that a hyperdisease was unlikely to have caused the extinction the two main theories to the extinction are climate change and human hunting the climate change theory has suggested that a change in climate near the end of the late pleistocene stressed the megafauna to the point of extinction some scientists favor abrupt climate change as the catalyst for the extinction of the mega-fauna at the end of the pleistocene but there are many who believe increased hunting from early modern humans also played a part with others even suggesting that the two interacted in the americas a controversial explanation for the shift in climate is presented under the younger dryas impact hypothesis
megafauna was once found on every continent of the world and large islands such as new zealand and madagascar but is now almost exclusively found on the continent of africa with notable comparisons on australia and the islands previously mentioned experiences population crashes and trophic cascades shortly after the earliest human settlers it has been suggested that the african megafauna survived as they evolved alongside humans the timing of south american megafaunal extinction does not appear to correspond to human arrival although the possibility of whether human activity at the time may have impacted the global climate enough to cause such an extinction has been suggested
it has been noted in the face of such evidence homo sapiens is unique in its ecology as an unprecedented 'global superpredator' regularly preying on large numbers of fully grown terrestrial and marine apex predators and with a great deal of influence over food webs and climatic systems worldwide
although significant debate exists as to how much human predation and indirect effects contributed to prehistoric extinctions certain population crashes have been directly correlated with human arrival
australia was once home to a large assemblage of megafauna with many parallels to those found on the african continent today australia's fauna is characterised by primarily marsupial mammals and many reptiles and birds all existing as giant forms until recently humans arrived on the continent very early about 50,000 years ago the extent human arrival contributed is controversial climatic drying of australia 40,000-60,000 years ago was an unlikely cause as it was less severe in speed or magnitude than previous regional climate change which failed to kill off megafauna
due to the older timeframe and the soil chemistry on the continent very little subfossil preservation evidence exists than elsewhere however continent-wide extinction of all genera weighing over 100 kilograms and six of seven genera weighing between 45 and 100 kilograms occurred around 46,400 years ago 4,000 years after human arrival and the fact that megafauna survived until a later date on the island of tasmania following the establishment of a land bridge suggest direct hunting or anthropogenic ecosystem disruption such as fire-stick farming as likely causes the first evidence of direct human predation leading to extinction in australia was published in 2016
extinctions in australia continued from original settlement until today in both plants and animals whilst many more animals and plants have declined or are endangered
there has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of megafauna at the end of the last glacial period can be attributed to human activities by hunting or even by slaughter of prey populations discoveries at monte verde in south america and at meadowcroft rock shelter in pennsylvania have caused a controversy regarding the clovis culture there likely would have been human settlements prior to the clovis culture and the history of humans in the americas may extend back many thousands of years before the clovis culture the amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated: for example in wrangel island in siberia the extinction of dwarf woolly mammoths approximately 2000 bce did not coincide with the arrival of humans nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the south american continent although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed
comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions approximately since the industrial revolution and the pleistocene extinction near the end of the last glacial period the latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the woolly mammoth and the carnivores that preyed on them we know that humans of this era actively hunted the mammoth and the mastodon but it is not known if this hunting was the cause of the subsequent massive ecological changes widespread extinctions and climate changes
the ecosystems encountered by the first americans had not been exposed to human interaction and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans therefore the actions of the clovis people despite seeming insignificant by today's standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence
the following species among many others became extinct in this period
human arrival around 6,000 years ago is correlated with the extinction of many species examples include:
recent research based on archaeological and paleontological digs on 70 different islands has shown that numerous species went extinct as people moved across the pacific starting 30,000 years ago in the bismarck archipelago and solomon islands it is currently estimated that among the bird species of the pacific some 2000 species have gone extinct since the arrival of humans representing a 20% drop in the biodiversity of birds worldwide among the extinctions were:
more recent settlement of isolated land masses where megafauna continued to survive almost immediately resulted in their extinction calculations suggest this occurred even if only a small number of animals were hunted it has been suggested this contemporary evidence supports the theory that humans were capable of causing or at least contributing to the extinctions of the quaternary extinction event
the first settlers are thought to have arrived in the islands between 300 and 800 ce with european arrival in the 16th century hawaii is notable for its endemism of plants birds insects mollusks and fish 30% of its organisms are endemic many of its species are endangered or have gone extinct primarily due to accidentally introduced species and livestock grazing over 40% of its bird species have gone extinct and it is the location of 75% of extinctions in the united states
extinction has increased in hawaii over the last 200 years and is relatively well documented with extinctions among native snails used as estimates for global extinction rates
starting circa 1500 years ago a number of species became extinct upon human settlement of the islands including:
within 500 years of the arrival of humans between 2,500-2,000 years ago nearly all of madagascar's distinct endemic and geographically isolated megafauna became extinct the largest animals of more than 150 kg were extincted very shortly after the first human arrival with large and medium-sized species dying out after prolonged hunting pressure from an expanding human population moving into more remote regions of the island around 1000 years ago smaller fauna experienced initial increases due to decreased competition and then subsequent declines over the last 500 years all fauna weighing over 10 kg died out the primary reasons for this are human hunting and habitat loss from early aridification both of which persist and threaten madagascar's remaining taxa today
one scientist estimates the current extinction rate may be 10,000 times the background extinction rate nevertheless most scientists predict a much lower extinction rate than this outlying estimate stuart pimm stated the current rate of species extinction is about 100 times the natural rate for plants mass extinctions are characterized by the loss of at least 75% of species within a geologically short period of time
in a pair of studies published in 2015 extrapolation from observed extinction of hawaiian snails led to the conclusion that 7% of all species on earth may have been lost already
megafaunal extinctions continue into the 21st century modern extinctions are more directly attributable to human influences extinction rates are minimized in the popular imaginat

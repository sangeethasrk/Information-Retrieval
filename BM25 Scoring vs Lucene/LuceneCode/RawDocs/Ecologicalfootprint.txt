ecological footprint - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
an ecological footprint is a measure of human impact on earth's ecosystems it's typically measured in area of wilderness or amount of natural capital consumed each year a common way of estimating footprint is the area of wilderness of both land and sea needed to supply resources to a human population this includes the area of wilderness needed to assimilate human waste
at a global scale it is used to estimate how rapidly we are depleting natural capital the global footprint network calculates the global ecological footprint from un and other data they estimate that as of 2007 our planet has been using natural capital 1.5 times as fast as nature can renew it


in 2007 the global footprint network estimated the global ecological footprint as 1.6 planet earths that is they judged that ecological services were being used 1.6 times as quickly as they were being renewed
ecological footprints can be calculated at any scale: for an activity a person a community a city a region a nation or humanity as a whole cities due to population concentration have large ecological footprints and have become ground zero for footprint reduction
global footprints: currently there is no fixed way to measure global footprints and any attempts to describe the capacity of an ecosystem in a single number is a massive simplification of thousands of key renewable resources which are not used or replenished at the same rate however there has been some convergence of metrics and standards since 2006
city ecological footprints: are being measured there are two types of measurements in use the first measures ecosystem displacement which is defined as city area minus remaining green spaces this is an area measurement that does not include human or other biological activity the second attempts to quantify surviving ecosystem health specifically it attempts to quantify both area and biological health of ecosystems surviving inside city areas such as nature reserves parks other green spaces city footprints are being calculated and ranked with city ecological indexes
the first academic publication about ecological footprints was by william rees in 1992 the ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the phd dissertation of mathis wackernagel under rees' supervision at the university of british columbia in vancouver canada from 1990â€“1994 originally wackernagel and rees called the concept appropriated carrying capacity to make the idea more accessible rees came up with the term ecological footprint inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer's small footprint on the desk in early 1996 wackernagel and rees published the book our ecological footprint: reducing human impact on the earth with illustrations by phil testemale
footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for carbon food housing and goods and services as well as the total footprint number of earths needed to sustain the world's population at that level of consumption this approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car this resource accounting is similar to life cycle analysis wherein the consumption of energy biomass food fiber building material water and other resources are converted into a normalized measure of land area called global hectares gha
per capita ecological footprint ef or ecological footprint analysis efa is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption the tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more or less than is available within its territory or to what extent the nation's lifestyle would be replicable worldwide the footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about carrying capacity and over-consumption with the aim of altering personal behavior ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not sustainable such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century
in 2007 the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 global hectares gha per capita the us footprint per capita was 9.0 gha and that of switzerland was 5.6 gha while china's was 1.8 gha the wwf claims that the human footprint has exceeded the biocapacity the available supply of natural resources of the planet by 20% wackernagel and rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006 because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas
a number of ngos offer ecological footprint calculators see footprint calculator below
ecological footprint analysis is now widely used around the earth as an indicator of environmental sustainability it can be used to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy it can be used to explore the sustainability of individual lifestyles goods and services organizations industry sectors neighborhoods cities regions and nations since 2006 a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures
the ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described in the l footprint atlas 2010 or in greater detail in the calculation methodology for the national footprint accounts the national accounts review committee has also published a research agenda on how the method will be improved
in 2003 jason venetoulis carl mas christopher gaudet dahlia chazan and john talberth developed footprint 2 which offers a series of theoretical and methodological improvements to the standard footprint approach the four primary improvements were that they included the entire surface of the earth in biocapacity estimates allocated space for other ie non-human species updated the basis of equivalence factors from agricultural land to net primary productivity npp and refined the carbon component of the footprint based on the latest global carbon models
the uk's average ecological footprint is 5.45 global hectares per capita gha with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha wales to 5.56 gha east england
two recent studies have examined relatively low-impact small communities bedzed a 96-home mixed-income housing development in south london was designed by bill dunster architects and sustainability consultants bioregional for the peabody trust despite being populated by relatively mainstream home-buyers bedzed was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production energy-efficient architecture and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site london's first carsharing club the report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured bedzed since its completion in 2002 findhorn ecovillage a rural intentional community in moray scotland had a total footprint of 2.56 gha including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of cluny hill college however the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha a little over half the uk national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world keveral farm an organic farming community in cornwall was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha though with substantial differences in footprints among community members
early criticism was published by van den bergh and verbruggen in 1999 which was updated in 2014 another criticism was published in 2008 a more complete review commissioned by the directorate-general for the environment european commission was published in june 2008 a number of countries have engaged in research collaborations to test the validity of the method this includes switzerland germany united arab emirates and belgium

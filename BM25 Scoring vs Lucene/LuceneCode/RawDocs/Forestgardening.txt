forest gardening - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
forest gardening is a low maintenance sustainable plant-based food production and agroforestry system based on woodland ecosystems incorporating fruit and nut trees shrubs herbs vines and perennial vegetables which have yields directly useful to humans making use of companion planting these can be intermixed to grow in a succession of layers to build a woodland habitat
forest gardening is a prehistoric method of securing food in tropical areas in the 1980s robert hart coined the term forest gardening after adapting the principles and applying them to temperate climates


forest gardens are probably the world's oldest form of land use and most resilient agroecosystem they originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions in the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment useful tree and vine species were identified protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the gardens
forest gardens are still common in the tropics and known by various names such as: home gardens in kerala in south india nepal zambia zimbabwe and tanzania kandyan forest gardens in sri lanka huertos familiares the family orchards of mexico and pekarangan the gardens of complete design in java these are also called agroforests and where the wood components are short-statured the term shrub garden is employed forest gardens have been shown to be a significant source of income and food security for local populations
robert hart adapted forest gardening for the united kingdom's temperate climate during the 1980s his theories were later developed by martin crawford from the agroforestry research trust and various permaculturalists such as graham bell patrick whitefield dave jacke and geoff lawton
forest gardens or home gardens are common in the tropics using intercropping to cultivate trees crops and livestock on the same land in kerala in south india as well as in northeastern india the home garden is the most common form of land use and is also found in indonesia one example combines coconut black pepper cocoa and pineapple these gardens exemplify polyculture and conserve much crop genetic diversity and heirloom plants that are not found in monocultures forest gardens have been loosely compared to the religious concept of the garden of eden

in many african countries for example zambia zimbabwe ethiopia and tanzania gardens are widespread in rural periurban and urban areas and they play an essential role in establishing food security most well known are the chaga or chagga gardens on the slopes of mt kilimanjaro in tanzania these are an excellent example of an agroforestry system in many countries women are the main actors in home gardening and food is mainly produced for subsistence in north-africa oasis layered gardening with palm trees fruit trees and vegetables is a traditional type of forest garden
in nepal the ghar bagaincha literally home garden refers to the traditional land use system around a homestead where several species of plants are grown and maintained by household members and their products are primarily intended for the family consumption shrestha et al 2002 the term “home garden” is often considered synonymous to the kitchen garden however they differ in terms of function size diversity composition and features sthapit et al 2006 in nepal 72% of households have home gardens of an area 2–11% of the total land holdings gautam et al 2004 because of their small size the government has never identified home gardens as an important unit of food production and they thereby remain neglected from research and development however at the household level the system is very important as it is an important source of quality food and nutrition for the rural poor and therefore are important contributors to the household food security and livelihoods of farming communities in nepal the gardens are typically cultivated with a mixture of annual and perennial plants that can be harvested on a daily or seasonal basis biodiversity that has an immediate value is maintained in home gardens as women and children have easy access to preferred food home gardens with their intensive and multiple uses provide a safety net for households when food is scarce these gardens are not only important sources of food fodder fuel medicines spices herbs flowers construction materials and income in many countries they are also important for the in situ conservation of a wide range of unique genetic resources for food and agriculture subedi et al 2004 many uncultivated as well as neglected and underutilised species could make an important contribution to the dietary diversity of local communities gautam et al 2004
in addition to supplementing diet in times of difficulty home gardens promote whole-family and whole-community involvement in the process of providing food children the elderly and those caring for them can participate in this infield agriculture incorporating it with other household tasks and scheduling this tradition has existed in many cultures around the world for thousands of years

robert hart coined the term forest gardening during the 1980s hart began farming at wenlock edge in shropshire with the intention of providing a healthy and therapeutic environment for himself and his brother lacon starting as relatively conventional smallholders hart soon discovered that maintaining large annual vegetable beds rearing livestock and taking care of an orchard were tasks beyond their strength however a small bed of perennial vegetables and herbs he planted was looking after itself with little intervention
following hart's adoption of a raw vegan diet for health and personal reasons he replaced his farm animals with plants the three main products from a forest garden are fruit nuts and green leafy vegetables he created a model forest garden from a 0.12 acre 500 m² orchard on his farm and intended naming his gardening method ecological horticulture or ecocultivation hart later dropped these terms once he became aware that agroforestry and forest gardens were already being used to describe similar systems in other parts of the world he was inspired by the forest farming methods of toyohiko kagawa and james sholto douglas and the productivity of the keralan home gardens as hart explains:
from the agroforestry point of view perhaps the world's most advanced country is the indian state of kerala which boasts no fewer than three and a half million forest gardensas an example of the extraordinary intensivity of cultivation of some forest gardens one plot of only 0.12 h

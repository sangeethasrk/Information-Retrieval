digital object identifier - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
a digital object identifier doi is a serial code used to uniquely identify objects the doi system is particularly used for electronic documents such as journal articles the doi system began in 2000
metadata about the object is stored in association with the doi name it may include a location such as a url where the object can be found the doi for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document whereas its location and other metadata may change referring to an online document by its doi provides more stable linking than simply referring to it by its url because if its url changes the publisher only needs to update the metadata for the doi to link to the new url
a doi name differs from standard identifier registries such as the isbn and isrc the purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers whereas the primary purpose of the doi system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable
organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the doi system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign dois the doi system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the international doi foundation which developed and controls the system the doi system has been developed and implemented in a range of publishing applications since 2000 by late april 2011 more than 50 million doi names had been assigned by some 4,000 organizations by april 2013 this number had grown to 85 million doi names assigned through 9,500 organizations the doi system uses but is not formally part of the handle system


a doi name takes the form of a character string divided into two parts a prefix and a suffix separated by a slash the prefix identifies the registrant of the name and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that doi most legal unicode characters are allowed in these strings which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner
for example in the doi name 10.1000 182 the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182 the 10 part of the prefix identifies the doi registry and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant in this case the registrant is the international doi foundation itself 182 is the suffix or item id identifying a single object in this case the latest version of the doi handbook
doi names can identify creative works such as texts images audio or video items and software in both electronic and physical forms performances and abstract works such as licenses parties to a transaction etc
the names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus doi names can identify a journal an individual issue of a journal an individual article in the journal or a single table in that article the choice of level of detail is left to the assigner but in the doi system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a doi name using a data dictionary based on the indecs content model
the official doi handbook explicitly states that dois should display on screens and in print in the format doi:10.1000 182 contrary to the doi handbook crossref a major doi registration agency recommends displaying a url for example http:  dxdoiorg 10.1000 182 instead of the officially specified format for example doi:10.1000 182 this url provides the location of an http proxy server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item this recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the doi is being displayed without being hyper-linked to its appropriate url â€“ the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full url to actually bring up the page for the doi thus the entire url should be displayed allowing people viewing the page containing the doi to copy-and-paste the url by hand into a new window tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the doi represents
major applications of the doi system currently include:
in the organisation for economic co-operation and development's publication service oecd ilibrary each table or graph in an oecd publication is shown with a doi name that leads to an excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs further development of such services is planned
a multilingual european doi registration agency activity medra traditional chinese content thru airiti inc and a chinese registration agency wanfang data are active in non-english language markets expansion to other sectors is planned by the international doi foundation
the doi system was designed to provide a form of persistent identification in which each doi name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated and it associates metadata with objects allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow doi names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found to achieve its goals the doi system combines the handle system and the indecs content model with a social infrastructure
the handle system ensures that the doi name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its doi name and that no two objects are assigned the same doi name because doi names are short character strings they are human-readable may be copied and pasted as text and fit into the uri specification the doi name resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service it is built on open architectures incorporates trust mechanisms and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the doi system doi name resolution may be used with openurl to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object according to the location of the user making the request however despite this ability the doi system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations
the indecs content model is used within the doi system to associate metadata with objects a small kernel of common metadata is shared by all doi names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data which may be public or restricted registrants may update the metadata for their doi names at any time such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different url
the international doi foundation idf oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure the social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering doi services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as gs1 and isbn
a doi name differs from commonly used internet pointers to material such as the uniform resource locator url in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time it implements the uniform resource identifier uniform resource name concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure
a doi name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the isbn isrc etc the purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers whereas the primary purpose of the doi system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections
the doi system offers persistent semantically-interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner eg public citation or managing content of value it uses a ma

the unified kingdom of denmark emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the baltic sea danish monarchs ruled the personal kalmar union established in 1397 of denmark norway and sweden which ended with swedish secession in 1523 denmark and norway remained under the same king until the union was dissolved by outside forces in 1814 caused by the black death the deterioration of the kingdom of norway made it possible for denmark to inherit an expansive colonial empire from this union of which the faroe islands and greenland are remnants beginning in the 17th century there were several cessions of territory these culminated in the 1830s with a surge of nationalist movements which were defeated in the 1864 second schleswig war denmark remained neutral during world war i in april 1940 a german invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the german surrender in may 1945 an industrialized exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed mixed economy
the constitution of denmark was signed on 5 june 1849 ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660 it establishes a constitutional monarchy—the current monarch is queen margrethe ii—organised as a parliamentary democracy the government and national parliament are seated in copenhagen the nation's capital largest city and main commercial centre denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the danish realm devolving powers to handle internal affairs denmark became a member of the european economic community in 1973 maintaining certain opt-outs it retains its own currency the krone it is among the founding members of nato the nordic council the oecd osce and the united nations it is also part of the schengen area

the etymology of the word denmark and especially the relationship between danes and denmark and the unifying of denmark as a single kingdom is a subject which attracts debate this is centred primarily on the prefix dan and whether it refers to the dani or a historical person dan and the exact meaning of the -mark ending
most handbooks derive the first part of the word and the name of the people from a word meaning flat land related to german tenne threshing floor english den cave the -mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland see marches with probable references to the border forests in south schleswig
the first recorded use of the word danmark within denmark itself is found on the two jelling stones which are runestones believed to have been erected by gorm the old c 955 and harald bluetooth c 965 the larger stone of the two is popularly cited as denmark's baptismal certificate dåbsattest though both use the word denmark in the form of accusative ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ tanmaurk danmɒrk on the large stone and genitive ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ tanmarkar pronounced danmarkaɽ on the small stone the inhabitants of denmark are there called tani danɪ or danes in the accusative
the earliest archaeological findings in denmark date back to the eem interglacial period from 130,000–110,000 bc denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 bc and agriculture has been evident since 3900 bc the nordic bronze age 1800–600 bc in denmark was marked by burial mounds which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the sun chariot
during the pre-roman iron age 500 bc – ad 1 native groups began migrating south and the first tribal danes came to the country between the pre-roman and the germanic iron age in the roman iron age ad 1–400 the roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in denmark and roman coins have been found in denmark evidence of strong celtic cultural influence dates from this period in denmark and much of north-west europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the gundestrup cauldron
the tribal danes came from the east danish islands zealand and scania and spoke an early form of north germanic historians believe that before their arrival most of jutland and the nearest islands were settled by tribal jutes the jutes migrated to great britain eventually some as mercenaries by brythonic king vortigern and were granted the south-eastern territories of kent the isle of wight and other areas where they settled they were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading angles and saxons who formed the anglo-saxons the remaining jutish population in jutland assimilated in with the settling danes
a short note about the dani in getica by the historian jordanes is believed to be an early mention of the danes one of the ethnic groups from whom modern danes are descended the danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in ad 737 are attributed to the emergence of a danish king a new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and ribe the oldest town of denmark was founded about ad 700
from the 8th to the 10th century denmark and the wider scandinavian region was the source of vikings they colonised raided and traded in all parts of europe viking explorers first discovered iceland by accident in the 9th century when heading for the faroe islands and norwegian vikings eventually came across vinland known today as newfoundland in canada the danish vikings were most active in the british isles and western europe they conquered and settled parts of england known as the danelaw under king sweyn forkbeard in 1013 ireland and france where danes and norwegians founded normandy with rollo as head of state more anglo-saxon pence of this period have been found in denmark than in england
as attested by the jelling stones the danes were united and christianised about 965 by harald bluetooth it is believed that denmark became christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising christian power in europe the holy roman empire which was an important trading area for the danes in that case harald built six fortresses around denmark called trelleborg and built a further danevirke in the early 11th century canute the great won and united denmark england and norway for almost 30 years with a scandinavian army
throughout the high and late middle ages denmark also included skåneland the areas of scania halland and blekinge in present-day south sweden and danish kings ruled danish estonia as well as the duchies of schleswig and holstein most of the latter two now form the state of schleswig-holstein in northern germany
in 1397 denmark entered into a personal union with norway and sweden united under queen margaret i the three countries were to be treated as equals in the union however even from the start margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating denmark as the clear senior partner of the union thus much of the next 125 years of scandinavian history revolves around this union with sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly the issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 june 1523 as swedish king gustav vasa conquered the city of stockholm the protestant reformation spread to scandinavia in the 1530s and following the count's feud civil war denmark converted to lutheranism in 1536 later that year denmark entered into a union with norway
after sweden permanently broke away from the personal union denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour king christian iv attacked sweden in the 1611–1613 kalmar war but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union the war led to no territorial changes but sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to denmark an amount known as the älvsborg ransom king christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses most notably glückstadt founded as a rival to hamburg and christiania inspired by the dutch east india company he founded a similar danish company and planned to claim ceylon as a colony but the company only managed to acquire tranquebar on india's coromandel coast denmark's large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in africa and india the empire was sustained by trade with other major powers and plantations – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation
in the thirty years' war christian tried to become the leader of the lutheran states in germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of lutter the result was that the catholic army under albrecht von wallenstein was able to invade occupy and pillage jutland forcing denmark to withdraw from the war denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions but king gustavus adolphus' intervention in germany was seen as a sign that the military power of sweden was on the rise while denmark's influence in the region was declining in 1643 swedish armies invaded jutland and claimed scania in 1644
in the 1645 treaty of brømsebro denmark surrendered halland gotland the last parts of danish estonia and several provinces in norway in 1657 king frederick iii declared war on sweden and marched on bremen-verden this led to a massive danish defeat and the armies of king charles x gustav of sweden conquered both jutland funen and much of zealand before signing the peace of roskilde in february 1658 which gave sweden control of scania blekinge trøndelag and the island of bornholm charles x gustav quickly regretted not having destroyed denmark completely and in august 1658 he began a two-year-long siege of copenhagen but failed to take the capital in the following peace settlement denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of trøndelag and bornholm
denmark tried to regain control of scania in the scanian war 1675-1679 but it ended in failure following the great northern war 1700–21 denmark managed to restore control of the parts of schleswig and holstein ruled by the house of holstein-gottorp in 1721 and 1773 respectively denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the eighteenth century due to its neutral status allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars in the napoleonic wars denmark traded with both france and the united kingdom and joined the league of armed neutrality with russia sweden and prussia the british considered this a hostile act and attacked copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807 in one case carrying off the danish fleet in the other burning large parts of the danish capital this led to the so-called danish-british gunboat war british control over the waterways between denmark and norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 denmark–norway went bankrupt
the danish-norwegian union was dissolved by the treaty of kiel in 1814 the danish monarchy irrevocably and forever renounced claims to the kingdom of norway in favour of the swedish king after the dissolution of the union with norway denmark kept the possessions of iceland which retained the danish monarchy until 1944 the faroe islands and greenland all of which had been governed by norway for centuries apart from the nordic colonies denmark continued to rule over danish india from 1620 to 1869 the danish gold coast ghana from 1658 to 1850 and the danish west indies from 1671 to 1917
a nascent danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s after the european revolutions of 1848 denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on 5 june 1849 a two-chamber parliament was established denmark faced war against both prussia and habsburg austria in what became known as the second schleswig war lasting from february to october 1864 denmark was defeated and obliged to cede schleswig and holstein to prussia this loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century after these events denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in europe
industrialization came to denmark in the second half of the 19th century the nation's first railroads were constructed in the 1850s and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of denmark's lack of natural resources trade unions developed starting in the 1870s there was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities and danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products
denmark maintained its neutral stance during world war i after the defeat of germany the versailles powers offered to return the region of schleswig-holstein to denmark fearing german irredentism denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a plebiscite the two schleswig plebiscites took place on 10 february and 14 march 1920 respectively on 10 july 1920 northern schleswig was recovered by denmark thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and 3,984 square kilometres 1,538 sq mi
in 1939 denmark signed a 10-year non-aggression pact with nazi germany but germany invaded denmark on 9 april 1940 and the danish government quickly surrendered world war ii in denmark was characterized by economic co-operation with germany until 1943 when the danish government refused further co-operation and its navy scuttled most of its ships and sent many of its officers to sweden which was neutral the danish resistance performed a rescue operation that managed to evacuate several thousand jews and their families to safety in sweden before the germans could send them to death camps some danes supported nazism by joining the danish nazi party or volunteering to fight with germany as part of the frikorps danmark iceland severed ties to denmark and became an independent republic in 1944 germany surrendered in may 1945 in 1948 the faroe islands gained home rule in 1949 denmark became a founding member of nato
denmark was a founding member of european free trade association efta during the 1960s the efta countries were often referred to as the outer seven as opposed to the inner six of what was then the european economic community eec in 1973 along with britain and ireland denmark joined the european economic community now the european union after a public referendum the maastricht treaty which involved further european integration was rejected by the danish people in 1992 it was only accepted after a second referendum in 1993 which provided for four opt-outs from policies the danes rejected the euro as the national currency in a referendum in 2000 greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded self-determination in 2009 neither the faroe islands nor greenland are members of the union the faroese having declined membership of the eec in 1973 and greenland in 1986 in both cases because of fisheries policies
constitutional change in 1953 led to a single-chamber parliament elected by proportional representation female accession to the danish throne and greenland becoming an integral part of denmark the centre-left social democrats led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century in a country generally known for its liberal traditions the liberal party and the conservative people's party have also led centre-right governments in recent years the danish people's party a right-wing populist party has emerged as a major party—becoming the second-largest following the 2015 general election—during which time immigration and integration have become major issues of public debate

denmark's northernmost point is skagen's point the north beach of the skaw at 57° 45' 7 northern latitude the southernmost is gedser point the southern tip of falster at 54° 33' 35 northern latitude the westernmost point is blåvandshuk at 8° 4' 22 eastern longitude and the easternmost point is østerskær at 15° 11' 55 eastern longitude this is in the archipelago ertholmene 18 kilometres 11 mi north-east of bornholm the distance from east to west is 452 kilometres 281 mi from north to south 368 kilometres 229 mi
the country is flat with little elevation having an average height above sea level of 31 metres 102 ft the highest natural point is møllehøj at 170.86 metres 560.56 ft a sizeable portion of denmark's terrain consists of rolling plains whilst the coastline is sandy with large dunes in northern jutland although once extensively forested today denmark largely consists of arable land it is drained by a dozen or so rivers and the most significant include the gudenå odense skjern suså and vidå—a river that flows along its southern border with germany
the kingdom of denmark includes two overseas territories both well to the west of denmark: greenland the world's largest island and the faroe islands in the north atlantic ocean these territories are self-governing and form part of the danish realm
denmark has a temperate climate characterised by mild winters with mean temperatures in january of 1.5 °c 34.7 °f and cool summers with a mean temperature in august of 17.2 °c 63.0 °f denmark has an average of 179 days per year with precipitation on average receiving a total of 765 millimetres 30 in per year autumn is the wettest season and spring the driest the position between a continent and an ocean means that weather often changes
because of denmark's northern location there are large seasonal variations in daylight there are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8:45 am and sunset 3:45 pm standard time as well as long summer days with sunrise at 4:30 am and sunset at 10 pm daylight saving time
denmark belongs to the boreal kingdom and can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the atlantic mixed forests and baltic mixed forests most of denmark's temperate forests have been substantially destroyed or fragmented chiefly for agricultural uses over the last millennia in all 12.9% of the land is forested roe deer occupy the countryside in growing numbers and large-antlered red deer can be found in the sparse woodlands of jutland the country is also home to smaller mammals such as hares and hedgehogs approximately 400 bird species inhabit denmark and about 160 of those breed in the country fish particularly cod herring and plaice are abundant in danish waters and form the basis for a large fishing industry
land and water pollution are two of denmark's most significant environmental issues although much of country's household and industrial waste is now recycled denmark has historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation in 1971 denmark established a ministry of environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973 to mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the danish government has signed the climate change-kyoto protocol however the national ecological footprint is 8.26 global hectares per person which is very high compared to a world average of 1.7 in 2010 contributing factors to this value are an exceptional high value for cropland but also a relatively high value for grazing land which may be explained by the substantially high meat production in denmark 115.8 kilograms 255 lb meat annually per capita and the large economic role of the meat and dairy industries in december 2014 the climate change performance index for 2015 placed denmark at the top of the table explaining that although emissions are still quite high the country was able to implement effective climate protection policies
denmark with a total area of 43,094 square kilometres 16,639 sq mi is divided into five administrative regions danish: regioner the regions are further subdivided into 98 municipalities kommuner the easternmost land in denmark the ertholmene archipelago with an area of 39 hectares 0.16 sq m is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the ministry of defence
the regions were created on 1 january 2007 to replace the sixteen former counties at the same time smaller municipalities were merged into larger units reducing the number from 270 most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability although a few exceptions were made to this rule the administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils elected proportionally every four years the most recent danish local elections were held on 19 november 2013 other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout including the police districts the court districts and the electoral wards
the governing bodies of the regions are the regional councils with forty-one members elected for four-year terms the head of the council is the regional council chairman regionsrådsformand who is elected by the council the areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the national health service social services and regional development unlike the counties they replaced the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is primarily financed by a national health care contribution of 6% sundhedsbidrag combined with funds from both government and municipalities
the area and populations of the regions vary widely for example the capital region which encompasses the copenhagen metropolitan area and the island of bornholm has a population three times larger than that of north denmark region which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern jutland under the county system certain densely populated municipalities such as copenhagen municipality and frederiksberg had been given a status equivalent to that of counties making them first-level administrative divisions these sui generis municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms
the kingdom of denmark is a unitary state that comprises in addition to denmark proper two autonomous constituent countries in the north atlantic ocean: greenland and the faroe islands they have been integrated parts of the danish realm since the 18th century however due to their separate historical and cultural identities these parts of the realm have extensive political powers and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields the faroe islands gained home rule in 1948 and greenland in 1979 having previously had the status of counties
the two territories have their own home governments and parliaments and are effectively self-governing in regards to domestic affairs high commissioners rigsombudsmand act as representatives of the danish government in the faroese løgting and in the greenlandic parliament but they cannot vote the faroese home government is defined to be an equal partner with the danish national government while the greenlandic people are defined as a separate people with the right to self-determination
the kingdom of denmark is a constitutional monarchy in which queen margrethe ii is the head of state the monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the council of state privy council however following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other government ministers the monarch is not answerable for his or her actions and the monarch's person is sacrosanct

denmark is a representative democracy with universal suffrage membership of the folketing is based on proportional representation of political parties with a 2% electoral threshold danes elect 175 members to the folketing with greenland and the faroe islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total parliamentary elections are held at least every four years but it is within the powers of the prime minister to ask the monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed on a vote of no confidence the folketing may force a single minister or the entire government to resign
the government of denmark operates as a cabinet government where executive authority is exercised—formally on behalf of the monarch—by the prime minister and other cabinet ministers who head ministries as the executive branch the cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget executing the laws and guiding the foreign and internal policies of denmark the position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of a majority in the folketing this is usually the current leader of the largest political party or more effectively through a coalition of parties a single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own denmark has often been ruled by coalition governments themselves sometimes minority governments dependent on non-government parties
following a general election defeat in june 2015 helle thorning-schmidt leader of the social democrats socialdemokraterne resigned as prime minister she was succeeded by lars løkke rasmussen the leader of the liberal party venstre rasmussen heads a cabinet which unusually consists entirely of ministers from his own party

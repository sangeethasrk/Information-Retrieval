renewable heat - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
renewable heat is an application of renewable energy and it refers to the renewable generation of heat rather than electrical power eg replacing a fossil fuel boiler using concentrating solar thermal to feed radiators renewable heat technologies include renewable biofuels solar heating geothermal heating heat pumps and heat exchangers to recover lost heat significant attention is also applied to insulation
many colder countries consume more energy for heating than electrical power for example in 2005 the united kingdom consumed 354 twh of electric power but had a heat requirement of 907 twh the majority of which 81% was met using gas the residential sector alone consumed a massive 550 twh of energy for heating mainly in the form of gas almost half of the final energy consumed in the uk 49% was in the form of heat of which 70% was used by households and in commercial and public buildings households used heat for mainly for space heating 69% and heating water
the relative competitiveness of renewable electricity and renewable heat depends on a nation's approach to energy and environment policy few renewable technologies whether for heat electricity or transport are competitive with fossil fuels without some form of carbon valuation or subsidy in those countries such as sweden denmark and finland where government intervention has been closest to a technology-neutral form of carbon valuation ie carbon and energy taxes renewable heat has played the leading role in a very substantial renewable contribution to final energy consumption in those countries such as germany spain the usa and the uk where government intervention has been set at different levels for different technologies uses and scales the contributions of renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies have depended on the relative levels of support and have resulted generally in a lower renewable contribution to final energy consumption


solar heating is a style of building construction which uses the energy of summer or winter sunshine to provide an economic supply of primary or supplementary heat to a structure the heat can be used for both space heating and water heating see solar hot water solar heating design is divided into two groups:
solar heating systems usually require a small supplementary backup heating system either conventional or renewable
geothermal energy is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil geothermal energy is an enormous underused heat and power resource that is clean emits little or no greenhouse gases reliable average system availability of 95% and homegrown making populations less dependent on oil
the earth absorbs the sun's energy and stores it as heat in the oceans and underground the ground temperature remains constant at a point of 42 to 100 °f 6 to 38 °c all year round depending on where you live on earth a geothermal heating system takes advantage of the consistent temperature found below the earth's surface and uses it to heat and cool buildings the system is made up of a series of pipes installed underground connected to pipes in a building a pump circulates liquid through the circuit in the winter the fluid in the pipe absorbs the heat of the earth and uses it to heat the building in the summer the fluid absorbs heat from the building and disposes of it in the earth
heat pumps use work to move heat from one place to another and can be used for both heating and air conditioning though capital intensive heat pumps are economical to run and can be powered by renewable electricity two common types of heat pump are air-source heat pumps ashp and ground-source heat pumps gshp depending on whether heat is transferred from the air or from the ground air source heat pumps are not effective when the outside air temperature is lower than about -15 °c while ground-source heat pumps are not affected the efficiency of a heat pump is measured by the coefficient of performance cop: for every unit of electricity used to pump the heat an air source heat pump generates 2.5 to 3 units of heat ie it has a cop of 2.5 to 3 whereas a gshp generates 3 to 3.5 units of heat based on current fuel prices for the united kingdom assuming a cop of 3-4 a gshp is sometimes a cheaper form of space heating than electric oil and solid fuel heating heat pumps can be linked to an interseasonal thermal energy storage hot or cold doubling the cop from 4 to 8 by extracting heat from warmer ground
a heat pump with interseasonal heat transfer combines active solar collection to store surplus summer heat in thermal banks with ground-source heat pumps to extract it for space heating in winter this reduces the lift needed and doubles the cop of the heat pump because the pump starts with warmth from the thermal bank in place of cold from the ground
a heat pump cop increases as the temperature difference or lift decreases between heat source and destination the cop can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature eg underfloor heating and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature eg the ground domestic hot water dhw and conventional radiators require high water temperatures affecting the choice of heat pump technology low temperature radiators provide an alternative to conventional radiators
renewable electricity can be generated by hydropower solar wind geothermal and by burning biomass in a few countries where renewable electricity is inexpensive resistance heating is common in countries like denmark where electricity is expensive it is not permitted to install electric heating as the main heat source wind turbines have more output at night when there is a small demand for electricity storage heaters consume this lower cost electricity at night and give off heat during the day
wood-pellet heating and other types of wood heating systems have achieved their greatest success in heating premises that are off the gas grid typically being previously heated using heating oil or coal solid wood fuel requires a large amount of dedicated storage space and the specialized heating systems can be expensive though grant schemes are available in many european countries to offset this capital cost low fuel costs mean that wood fuelled heating in europe is frequently able to achieve a payback period of less than 3 to 5 years because of the large fuel storage requirement wood fuel can be less attractive in urban residential scenarios or for premises connected to the gas grid though rising gas prices and uncertainty of supply mean that wood fuel is becoming more competitive there is also growing concern over the air pollution from wood heating versus oil or gas heat especially the fine particulates
burning wood fuel in an open fire is both extremely inefficient 0-20% and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion in the same way that a drafty building loses heat through loss of warm air through poor sealing an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of warm air out of the building
modern wood stove designs allow for more efficient combustion and then heat extraction in the united states new wood stoves are certified by the us environmental protection agency epa and burn cleaner and more efficiently the overall efficiency is 60-80% and draw smaller volumes of warm air from the building
cleaner should not however be confused with clean an australian study of real-life emissions from woodheaters satisfying the current australian standard found that particle emissions averaged 9.4 g kg wood burned range 2.6 to 21.7 a heater with average wood consumption of 4 tonnes per year therefore emits 37.6 kg of pm2.5 ie particles less than 2.5 micrometers this can be compared with a passenger car satisfying the current euro 5 standards introduced september 2009 of 0.005 g km so one new wood heater emits as much pm2.5 per year as 367 passenger cars each driving 20,000 km a year a recent european study identified pm2.5 as the most health-hazardous air pollutant causing an estimated 492,000 premature deaths the

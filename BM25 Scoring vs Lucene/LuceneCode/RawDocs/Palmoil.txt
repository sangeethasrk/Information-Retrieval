palm oil - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
palm oil also known as dendê oil from portuguese is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp reddish pulp of the fruit of the oil palms primarily the african oil palm elaeis guineensis and to a lesser extent from the american oil palm elaeis oleifera and the maripa palm attalea maripa
palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high beta-carotene content it is not to be confused with palm kernel oil derived from the kernel of the same fruit or coconut oil derived from the kernel of the coconut palm cocos nucifera the differences are in color raw palm kernel oil lacks carotenoids and is not red and in saturated fat content: palm mesocarp oil is 41% saturated while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81% and 86% saturated respectively
along with coconut oil palm oil is one of the few highly saturated vegetable fats and is semi-solid at room temperature like most plant-based products palm oil contains very little cholesterol
palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of africa southeast asia and parts of brazil its use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is widespread because of its lower cost and the high oxidative stability saturation of the refined product when used for frying
the use of palm oil in food products has attracted the concern of environmental activist groups the high oil yield of the trees has encouraged wider cultivation leading to the clearing of forests in parts of indonesia in order to make space for oil-palm monoculture this has resulted in significant acreage losses of the natural habitat of the orangutan of which both species are endangered one species in particular the sumatran orangutan has been listed as critically endangered in 2004 an industry group called the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo was formed to work with the palm oil industry to address these concerns additionally in 1992 in response to concerns about deforestation the malaysian government pledged to limit the expansion of palm oil plantations by retaining a minimum of half the nation's land as forest cover
human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years in the late 1800s archaeologists discovered a substance that they concluded was originally palm oil in a tomb at abydos dating back to 3,000 bce it is believed that arab traders brought the oil palm to egypt it is not possible that arab traders could have brought the oil palm to ancient egypt as the arabs did not settle in africa until the 8th century ce it is more likely that the oil palm was brought to ancient egypt kemet by its founding peoples who migrated from other regions of the african continent ref:chiekh anta diop the african origin of civilization: myth or reality paperback – 1 jul 1989
palm oil from elaeis guineensiss has long been recognized in west and central african countries and is widely used as a cooking oil european merchants trading with west africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in europe
palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by british traders for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery during britain's industrial revolution
palm oil formed the basis of soap products such as lever brothers' now unilever sunlight soap and the american palmolive brand
by around 1870 palm oil constituted the primary export of some west african countries such as ghana and nigeria although this was overtaken by cocoa in the 1880s
palm oil like all fats is composed of fatty acids esterified with glycerol palm oil has an especially high concentration of saturated fat specifically of the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid palmitic acid to which it gives its name monounsaturated oleic acid is also a major constituent of palm oil unrefined palm oil is a large natural source of tocotrienol part of the vitamin e family
the approximate concentration of fatty acids in palm oil is:
when unrefined or when processed into red palm oil it is naturally rich in carotenes which give it its characteristic dark red color like tomatoes carrots and many other fruits and vegetables but unlike most oils palm oil naturally contains the nutrients alpha-carotene beta-carotene and lycopene palm oil contains other carotenes including tocopherols and tocotrienols members of the vitamin e family coq10 phytosterols and glycolipids
many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients derived from it
after milling various palm oil products are made using refining processes first is fractionation with crystallization and separation processes to obtain solid stearin and liquid olein fractions then melting and degumming removes impurities then the oil is filtered and bleached physical refining removes smells and coloration to produce refined bleached and deodorized palm oil rbdpo and free sheer fatty acids which are used in the manufacture of soaps washing powder and other products rbdpo is the basic palm oil product sold on the world's commodity markets many companies fractionate it further to produce palm olein for cooking oil or process it into other products
since the mid-1990s red palm oil has been cold-pressed and bottled for use as cooking oil and blended into mayonnaise and salad oil
red palm oil antioxidants like tocotrienols and carotenes are added to foods and cosmetics because of their purported health benefits
the highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions making it a cheap substitute for butter or trans fats in uses where solid fat is desirable such as the making of pastry dough and baked goods a recent rise in the use of palm oil in the food industry has partly come from changed labelling requirements that have caused a switch away from using trans fats palm oil has been found to be a reasonable replacement for trans fats however a small study conducted in 2009 found that palm oil may not be a good substitute for trans fats for individuals with already-elevated ldl levels the usda agricultural research service states that palm oil is not a healthy substitute for trans fats
palm oil is used to produce both methyl ester and hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel palm oil methyl ester is created through a process called transesterification palm oil biodiesel is often blended with other fuels to create palm oil biodiesel blends palm oil biodiesel meets the european en 14214 standard for biodiesels hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel is produced by direct hydrogenolysis of the fat into alkanes and propane the world's largest palm oil biodiesel plant is the finnish-operated neste oil biodiesel plant in singapore which opened in 2011 and produces hydrodeoxygenated nexbtl biodiesel
the organic waste matter that is produced when processing oil palm including oil palm shells and oil palm fruit bunches can also be used to produce energy this waste material can be converted into pellets that can be used as a biofuel additionally palm oil that has been used to fry foods can be converted into methyl esters for biodiesel the used cooking oil is chemically treated to create a biodiesel similar to petroleum diesel
although palm oil is applied to wounds for its supposed antimicrobial effects research does not confirm its effectiveness
as of 2012 the annual revenue received by indonesia and malaysia together the top two producers of palm oil is us$40 billion between 1962 and 1982 global exports of palm oil increased from around half a million to 2.4 million tonnes annually and in 2008 world production of palm oil and palm kernel oil amounted to 48 million tonnes according to fao forecasts by 2020 the global demand for palm oil will double and triple by 2050
indonesia is the largest producer of palm oil surpassing malaysia in 2006 producing more than 20.9 million tonnes indonesia expects to double production by the end of 2030 at the end of 2010 60 percent of the output was exported in the form of crude palm oil fao data show production increased by over 400% between 1994 and 2004 to over 8.66 million metric tonnes
in 2012 malaysia the world's second largest producer of palm oil produced 18.79 million tonnes of crude palm oil on roughly 5,000,000 hectares 19,000 sq mi of land though indonesia produces more palm oil malaysia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil having exported 18 million tonnes of palm oil products in 2011 china pakistan the european union india and the united states are the primary importers of malaysian palm oil products
as of 2011 nigeria was the third-largest producer with approximately 2.3 million hectares 5.7×10  acres under cultivation until 1934 nigeria had been the world's largest producer both small- and large-scale producers participated in the industry
in 2013 thailand produced 2.0 million tonnes of crude palm oil on roughly 626 thousand hectaresfaostat
in the 1960s about 18,000 hectares 69 sq mi were planted with palm colombia has now become the largest palm oil producer in the americas and 35% of its product is exported as biofuel in 2006 the colombian plantation owners' association fedepalma reported that oil palm cultivation was expanding to 1,000,000 hectares 3,900 sq mi this expansion is being funded in part by the united states agency for international development to resettle disarmed paramilitary members on arable land and by the colombian government which proposes to expand land use for exportable cash crops to 7,000,000 hectares 27,000 sq mi by 2020 including oil palms fedepalma states that its members are following sustainable guidelines
some afro-colombians claim that some of these new plantations have been expropriated from them after they had been driven away through poverty and civil war while armed guards intimidate the remaining people to further depopulate the land with coca production and trafficking following in their wake
palm is native to the wetlands of western africa and south benin already hosts many palm plantations its 'agricultural revival programme' has identified many thousands of hectares of land as suitable for new oil palm export plantations in spite of the economic benefits non-governmental organisations ngos such as nature tropicale claim biofuels will compete with domestic food production in some existing prime agricultural sites other areas comprise peat land whose drainage would have a deleterious environmental impact they are also concerned genetically modified plants will be introduced into the region jeopardizing the current premium paid for their non-gm crops
cameroon has a production project underway initiated by herakles farms in the us however the project has been halted under the pressure of greenpeace wwf and other civil society organizations in cameroon before the project was halted herakles left the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo early on in negotiations the project has been controversial due to opposition from villagers and the location of the project in a biodiversity hotspot
kenya's domestic production of edible oils covers about a third of its annual demand estimated at around 380,000 metric tonnes the rest is imported at a cost of around us$140 million a year making edible oil the country's second most important import after petroleum since 1993 a new hybrid variety of cold-tolerant high-yielding oil palm has been promoted by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations in western kenya as well as alleviating the country's deficit of edible oils while providing an important cash crop it is claimed to have environmental benefits in the region because it does not compete against food crops or native vegetation and it provides stabilisation for the soil
ghana has a lot of palm nut species which may become an important contributor to the agriculture of the region although ghana has multiple palm species ranging from local palm nuts to other species locally called agric it was only marketed locally and to neighboring countries production is now expanding as major investment funds are purchasing plantations because ghana is considered a major growth area for palm oil
according to the hamburg-based oil world trade journal in 2008 global production of oils and fats stood at 160 million tonnes palm oil and palm kernel oil were jointly the largest contributor accounting for 48 million tonnes or 30% of the total output soybean oil came in second with 37 million tonnes 23% about 38% of the oils and fats produced in the world were shipped across oceans of the 60.3 million tonnes of oils and fats exported around the world palm oil and palm kernel oil made up close to 60% malaysia with 45% of the market share dominated the palm oil trade
previously palm oil could be listed as vegetable fat or vegetable oil on food labels in the european union eu from december 2014 food packaging in the eu is no longer allowed to use the generic terms vegetable fat or vegetable oil in the ingredients list food producers are required to list the specific type of vegetable fat used including palm oil vegetable oils and fats can be grouped together in the ingredients list under the term vegetable oils or vegetable fats but this must be followed by the type of vegetable origin eg palm sunflower or rapeseed and the phrase in varying proportions
palm oil is also an important source of calories and a food staple in poor communities however its overall health impacts particularly in relation to cardiovascular disease are controversial and subject to ongoing research
much of the palm oil that is consumed as food is cooking oil to some degree oxidized rather than in the fresh state and this oxidation appears to be responsible for the health risk associated with consuming palm oil
several studies have linked palm oil to higher risks of cardiovascular disease including a 2005 study conducted in costa rica which indicated that replacing palm oil in cooking with polyunsaturated non-hydrogenated oils could reduce the risk of heart attacks and a 2011 analysis of 23 countries which showed that for each kilogram of palm oil added to the diet annually there was an increase in ischemic heart disease deaths 68 deaths per 100,000 increase though the increase was much smaller in high-income countries
according to studies reported on by the center for science in the public interest cspi excessive intake of palmitic acid which makes up 44 percent of palm oil increases blood cholesterol levels and may contribute to heart disease the cspi also reported that the world health organization and the us national heart lung and blood institute have encouraged consumers to limit the consumption of palmitic acid and foods high in saturated fat according to the world health organization evidence is convincing that consumption of palmitic acid increases risk of developing cardiovascular diseases placing it in the same evidence category as trans fatty acids
however a 1993 study published by the united nations university press found that consumption of palmitic acid appeared to have no impact on cholesterol levels when daily intake is below 400 mg per day
in response to negative reports on palm oil many food manufacturers transitioned to using hydrogenated vegetable oils in their products which have also come under scrutiny for the impact these oils have on health a 2006 study supported by the national institutes of health and the usda agricultural research service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats trans fats in the food industry because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of ldl cholesterol and apolipoprotein b just as trans fat does however according to two reports published in 2010 by the journal of the american college of nutrition palm oil is again an accepted replacement for hydrogenated vegetable oils and a natural replacement for partially hydrogenated vegetable oils which are a significant source of trans fats
not all saturated fats have equally cholesterolemic effects studies have indicated that consumption of palm olein which is more unsaturated reduces blood cholesterol when compared to sources of saturated fats like coconut oil dairy and animal fats
in 1996 dr decker of university of massachusetts medical school stressed that saturated fats in the sn–1 and -3 position of triacylglycerols exhibit different metabolic patterns because of their low

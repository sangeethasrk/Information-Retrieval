national security - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
national security is a concept that a government along with its parliaments should protect the state and its citizens against all kind of national crises through a variety of power projections such as political power diplomacy economic power military might and so on
the concept developed mostly in the united states after world war ii initially focusing on military might it now encompasses a broad range of facets all of which impinge on the non-military or economic security of the nation and the values espoused by the national society accordingly in order to possess national security a nation needs to possess economic security energy security environmental security etc security threats involve not only conventional foes such as other nation-states but also non-state actors such as violent non-state actors narcotic cartels multinational corporations and non-governmental organisations some authorities include natural disasters and events causing severe environmental damage in this category
measures taken to ensure national security include:


there is no single universally accepted definition of national security the variety of definitions provide an overview of the many usages of this concept the concept still remains ambiguous having originated from simpler definitions which initially emphasised the freedom from military threat and political coercion to later increase in sophistication and include other forms of non-military security as suited the circumstances of the time
a typical dictionary definition in this case from the macmillan dictionary online version defines the term as the protection or the safety of a country’s secrets and its citizens emphasising the overall security of a nation and a nation state walter lippmann in 1943 defined it in terms of war saying that a nation has security when it does not have to sacrifice its legitimate ínterests to avoid war and is able if challenged to maintain them by war a later definition by harold lasswell a political scientist in 1950 looks at national security from almost the same aspect that of external coercion:
the distinctive meaning of national security means freedom from foreign dictation
arnold wolfers 1960 while recognising the need to segregate the subjectivity of the conceptual idea from the objectivity talks of threats to acquired values:
an ambiguous symbol meaning different things to different people national security objectively means the absence of threats to acquired values and subjectively the absence of fear that such values will be attacked
the 1996 definition propagated by the national defence college of india accretes the elements of national power:
national security is an appropriate and aggressive blend of political resilience and maturity human resources economic structure and capacity technological competence industrial base and availability of natural resources and finally the military might
harold brown us secretary of defense from 1977 to 1981 in the carter administration enlarged the definition of national security by including elements such as economic and environmental security:
national security then is the ability to preserve the nation's physical integrity and territory to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms to preserve its nature institution and governance from disruption from outside and to control its borders
in harvard university history professor charles maier's definition of 1990 national security is defined through the lens of national power:
national security is best described as a capacity to control those domestic and foreign conditions that the public opinion of a given community believes necessary to enjoy its own self-determination or autonomy prosperity and wellbeing
according to prabhakaran paleri author of national security imperatives and challenges national security may be defined as:
the measurable state of the capability of a nation to overcome the multi-dimensional threats to the apparent well-being of its people and its survival as a nation-state at any given time by balancing all instruments of state policy through governancethat can be indexed by computation empirically or otherwise and is extendable to global security by variables external to it
the origin of the modern concept of national security as a philosophy of maintaining a stable nation state can be traced to the peace of westphalia wherein the concept of a sovereign state ruled by a sovereign became the basis of a new international order of nation states it was thomas hobbes in his 1651 work leviathan who stated that citizens yield to a powerful sovereign who in turn promises an end to civil and religious war and to bring forth a lasting peace and give him the right to conduct policy including wage war or negotiate for peace for the good of the commonwealth ie a mandate for national security the clausewitzian view of diplomacy and war being the instruments of furthering national cause added to the view of national security being sought by nations by exercising self-interest at all times this view came to be known as classical realism in international relations
immanuel kant in his 1795 essay perpetual peace: a philosophical sketch zum ewigen frieden de proposed a system where nation-states and dominating national interests were replaced by an enlightened world order a community of mankind where nation-states subsumed the national interests under the rule of the international law because of rational insight common good and moral commitment national security was achieved by this voluntary accession by the leadership to a higher order than the nation-state viz international security thus was born the idealist school of international relations
as an academic concept national security can be seen as a recent phenomenon which was first introduced in the united states after world war ii and has to some degree replaced other concepts that describe the struggle of states to overcome various external and internal threats the term was used during discourse on war for example walter lippmann in 1943 criticized an unwillingness of political pundits to discuss the foundations of national security in a time of peace however the earliest mention of the term national security can be traced to 1790 in yale university in reference to its relation with domestic industries
as in the case of national power the military aspect of security is an important but not the sole component of national security to be truly secure a nation needs other forms of security authorities differ in their choice of nation security elements besides the military aspect of security the aspects of diplomacy or politics society environment energy and natural resources and economics are commonly listed the elements of national security corelate closely to the concept of the elements of national power romm 1993 lists security from narcotic cartels economic security environmental security and energy security as the non-military elements of national security
this is traditionally the earliest recognised form of national security military security implies the capability of a nation to defend itself and or deter military aggression alternatively military security implies the capability of a nation to enforce its policy choices by use of military force the term military security is considered synonymous with security in much of its usage one of the definitions of security given in the dictionary of military and associated terms may be considered a definition of military security:
a condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that ensure a state of inviolability from hostile acts or influences
the political aspect of security has been offered by barry buzan ole wæver jaap de wilde as an important component of national security political security is about the stability of the social order closely allied to military security and societal security other components proposed in a framework for national security in their book security: a new framework for analysis it specifically addresses threats to sovereignty system referent objects are defined such as nation-states nations transnational groups of political importance including tribes minorities some religious organisations systems of states such as the european union and the united nations besides others diplomacy negotiation and other interactions form the means of interaction between the objects

environmental security deals with environmental issues which threaten the national security of a nation in any manner the scope and nature of environmental threats to national security and strategies to engage them are a subject of debate while all environmental events are not considered significant of being categorised as threats many transnational issues both global and regional would affect national security romm 1993 classifies these as :

the concept of national security became an official guiding principle of foreign policy in the united states when the national security act of 1947 was signed on july 26 1947 by us president harry s truman as amended in 1949 this act:
notably the act did not define national security which was conceivably advantageous as its ambiguity made it a powerful phrase to invoke whenever issues threatened by other interests of the state such as domestic concerns came up for discussion and decision
the notion that national security encompasses more than just military security was present though understated from the beginning the act established the national security council so as to advise the president on the integration of domestic military and foreign policies relating to national security
while not defining the interests of national security the act does establish within the national security council the committee on foreign intelligence whose duty is to conduct an annual review identifying the intelligence required to address the national security interests of the united states as specified by the president emphasis added

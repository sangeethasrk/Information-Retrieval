environmental degradation - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as air water and soil the destruction of ecosystems and the extinction of wildlife it is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable as indicated by the i=pat equation environmental impact i or degradation is caused by the combination of an already very large and increasing human population p continually increasing economic growth or per capita affluence a and the application of resource depleting and polluting technology t
environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the high-level panel on threats challenges and change of the united nations the united nations international strategy for disaster reduction defines environmental degradation as the reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives and needs environmental degradation is of many types when natural habitats are destroyed or natural resources are depleted the environment is degraded efforts to counteract this problem include environmental protection and environmental resources management


one major component of environmental degradation is the depletion of the resource of fresh water on earth approximately only 2.5% of all of the water on earth is fresh water with the rest being salt water 69% of the fresh water is frozen in ice caps located on antarctica and greenland so only 30% of the 2.5% of fresh water is available for consumption fresh water is an exceptionally important resource since life on earth is ultimately dependent on it water transports nutrients and chemicals within the biosphere to all forms of life sustains both plants and animals and moulds the surface of the earth with transportation and deposition of materials
the current top three uses of fresh water account for 95% of its consumption approximately 85% is used for irrigation of farmland golf courses and parks 6% is used for domestic purposes such as indoor bathing uses and outdoor garden and lawn use and 4% is used for industrial purposes such as processing washing and cooling in manufacturing centers it is estimated that one in three people over the entire globe are already facing water shortages almost one-fifth of the world's population live in areas of physical water scarcity and almost one quarter of the world's population live in a developing country that lacks the necessary infrastructure to use water from available rivers and aquifers water scarcity is an increasing problem due to many foreseen issues in the future including population growth increased urbanization higher standards of living and climate change
climate change affects the earth's water supply in a large number of ways it is predicted that the mean global temperature will rise in the coming years due to a number of forces affecting the climate the amount of atmospheric co2 will rise and both of these will influence water resources evaporation depends strongly on temperature and moisture availability which can ultimately affect the amount of water available to replenish groundwater supplies
transpiration from plants can be affected by a rise in atmospheric co2 which can decrease their use of water but can also raise their use of water from possible increases of leaf area temperature increase can decrease the length of the snow season in the winter and increase the intensity of snowmelt in warmer seasons leading to peak runoff of snowmelt earlier in the season affecting soil moisture flood and drought risks and storage capacities depending on the area
warmer winter temperatures cause a decrease in snowpack which can result in diminished water resources during summer this is especially important at mid-latitudes and in mountain regions that depend on glacial runoff to replenish their river systems and groundwater supplies making these areas increasingly vulnerable to water shortages over time an increase in temperature will initially result in a rapid rise in water melting from glaciers in the summer followed by a retreat in glaciers and a decrease in the melt and consequently the water supply every year as the size of these glaciers get smaller and smaller
thermal expansion of water and increased melting of oceanic glaciers from an increase in temperature gives way to a rise in sea level which can affect the fresh water supply of coastal areas as well as river mouths and deltas with higher salinity get pushed further inland an intrusion of saltwater results in an increase of salinity in reservoirs and aquifers sea-level rise may also consequently be caused by a depletion of groundwater as climate change can affect the hydrologic cycle in a number of ways uneven distributions of increased temperatures and increased precipitation around the globe results in water surpluses and deficits but a global decrease in groundwater suggests a rise in sea level even after meltwater and thermal expansion were accounted for which can provide a positive feedback to the problems sea-level rise causes to fresh-water supply
a rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth an increase in water temperature can also affect ecosystems greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature and also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature
a rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff floods increased rates of soil erosion and mass movement of land a decline in water quality is probable while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants while most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture it is generally expected that on average global precipitation will increase with some areas receiving increases and some decreases
climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation such as in the tropics and higher latitudes other areas are expected to see a decrease such as in the subtropics this will ultimately cause a latitudinal variation in water distribution the areas receiving more precipitation are also expected to receive this increase during their winter and actually become drier during their summer creating even more of a variation of precipitation distribution naturally the distribution of precipitation across the planet is very uneven causing constant variations in water availability in respective locations
changes in precipitation affect the timing and magnitude of floods and droughts shift runoff processes and alter groundwater recharge rates vegetation patterns and growth rates will be directly affected by shifts in precipitation amount and distribution which will in turn affect agriculture as well as natural ecosystems decreased precipitation will deprive areas of water causing water tables to fall and reservoirs and wetlands rivers and lakes to empty and possibly an increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration depending on the accompanied rise in temperature groundwater reserves will be depleted and the remaining water has a greater chance of being of poor quality from saline or contaminants on the land surface
the population on earth is expanding rapidly which goes hand in hand in the degradation of the environment at large measures the humanâ€™s appetites for needs are disarranging the environments natural equilibrium our production industries are venting smoke and discharging chemicals that are polluting our water the smoke that is emitted into the atmosphere holds unappealing gases such as carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide the high levels of pollution in the atmosphere form layers that are eventuall

renewable energy in brazil - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
renewable energy in brazil accounted for more than 85.4% of the domestically produced electricity used in brazil according to data from the 2009 national energy balance conducted by the energy research corporation epe after the oil shocks of the 1970s brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy mainly sugarcane ethanol its large sugarcane farms helped in 1985 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol the success of flexible-fuel vehicles introduced in 2003 together with the mandatory e25 blend throughout the country have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by february 2008
brazil held its first wind-only energy auction in 2009 in a move to diversify its energy portfolio foreign companies scrambled to take part early this decade a drought in brazil that cut water to the country's hydroelectric dams prompted severe energy shortages the crisis which ravaged the country's economy and led to electricity rationing underscored brazil's pressing need to diversify away from water power the bidding is expected to lead to the construction of two gigawatts of wind production with an investment of about us$6 billion of over the next two years brazil counts on hydroelectricity for more than 3 4 of its electricity but authorities are pushing biomass and wind as primary alternatives wind energy's greatest potential in brazil is during the dry season so it is considered a hedge against low rainfall and the geographical spread of existing hydro resources brazil's technical potential for wind energy is 143 gigawatts due to the country's blustery 4,600-mile coastline where most projects are based the brazilian wind energy association and the government have set a goal of achieving 20 gigawatts of wind energy capacity by 2020 from the current 5 gigawatts 2014 the industry hopes the auction will help kick-start the wind-energy sector which already accounts for 70% of the total in all of latin america


wind power in brazil amounts to an installed capacity of 5 gw in mid 2014 potential of wind in brazil is more intense from june to december coinciding with the months of lower rainfall intensity this puts the wind as a potential supplementary source of energy generated by hydroelectric in 2009 10 projects are under construction with a capacity of 256 mw and in 2010 45 began construction to generate 2,139 mw in several states the us company general electric has one industry in brazil in the city of campinas and one partnership with the tecsis in sorocaba meeting the demand of the new projects
while the 2009 united nations climate change conference cop15 was taking place in copenhagen brazil's national electric energy agency aneel held the country's first ever wind-only energy auction on december 14 around 1,800 megawatts mw were contracted with energy from 71 wind power plants scheduled to be delivered beginning july 1 2012 while focusing domestically on wind-energy generation brazil is part of a larger international movement toward wind power as a primary source of energy in fact wind power has seen the highest expansion rate of all available renewable energy sources with an average growth of 27% per year since 1990 according to the global wind energy council gwec
brazil's first wind-energy turbine was installed in fernando de noronha archipelago in 1992 ten years later the government created the program for incentive of alternative electric energy sources proinfa to encourage the use of other renewable sources such as wind power biomass and small hydroelectric power stations pchs such stations use hydropower the flagship of brazil's energy matrix which comprises around three-quarters of brazil's installed energy capacity
high energy production costs coupled with the advantages of wind power as a renewable widely available energy source have led several countries to establish regulatory incentives and direct financial investments to stimulate wind power generation
since the inception of proinfa brazil's wind energy production has escalated from 22 mw in 2003 to 602 mw in 2009 as part of 36 private projects another 10 projects are under construction with a capacity of 256.4 mw and 45 additional projects have been approved by aneel with an estimated potential of 2,139.7 mw
developing these wind power sources in brazil is helping the country to meet its strategic objectives of enhancing energy security reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating jobs the potential for this type of power generation in brazil could reach up to 145,000 mw according to the 2001 brazilian wind power potential report by the electric energy research centre cepel
the cost of energy production continues to pose a significant challenge to the growth of wind energy the price per megawatt hour mwh established in brazil's auction of wind power reserve supply is r$189 while the cap defined in bidding for power plants of the madeira river hydroelectricity complex was r$91 uhe jirau in 2008 and r$122 uhe santo antonio in 2007 these hydroelectricity prices were marked down by up to 35% in the 2008 and 2007 auctions the energy supply was negotiated at r$71.4 mwh in the case of jirau and r$78.9 mwh for the santo antonio plant
the total installed photovoltaic power capacity in brazil is estimated to be between 12 and 15 mwp of which 50% is for telecommunications systems and 50% for rural energy systems it is less than 0.01% of the energy in brazil
brazil has one of the highest solar incidence in the world
built on the paran√° river dividing brazil and paraguay the itaipu dam is the world's second largest hydroelectric dam the river runs long the border of the two countries and during the initial diplomatic talks of constructing the dam both countries were suffering from droughts the original goal was to provide better management and utilization over water resources for the use of irrigation of crops argentina was also later incorporated in some of the governmental planning and agreements because it is a directly affected being down stream by the regulation of the water on the river if the dam were to completely open the water flow areas as far south as buenos aires could potentially flood construction of the dam started in 1975 and the first generator was opened in 1983 today the dam provides over 75% of paraguay's electric power needs and meets nearly 25% of brazil's electricity demands it is estimated that 10,000 locals were displaced by the construction of the dam and around 40,000 people were hired to help with the construction of the project many environmental concerns were overlooked when constructing the dam because the dam would produce such a large amount of energy with carbon free emissions and no unwanted byproducts such as with nuclear energy
hydroelectric power plants produce almost 80% of the electrical energy consumed in brazil they depend on river waters in adequate levels in their ponds to generate energy lack of rainfall investments and increased consumption resulted in electrical energy rationalization known as black out in the years 2001 and 2002 the construction of new hydroelectric power plants means environmental impacts as large areas need to be flooded altering the ecosystem
trying not to use too much energy during peak hours between 6 and 9 pm is necessary to avoid the need to build new energy plants and transmission lines only to serve the demand in that timeframe new dams mean very elevated social and environmental costs due to flooding land tracts and destroying habitats of animals plants and entire communities that many times are not compensated resettlement or indemnities large hydroelectric power plants flooding immense forest areas emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere there is only sustainable development with energy coming from new renewable sources small hydroelectric plants can produce energy in a decentralized way with small environmental impact such an option can be implemented in several regions of the country making use of natural waterfalls many brazilian farmers chose this

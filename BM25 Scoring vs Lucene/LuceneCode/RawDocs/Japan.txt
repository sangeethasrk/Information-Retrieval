japan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called yamataikoku buddhism was first introduced to japan from baekje of korea but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period 592–710
the nara period 710–784 of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong japanese state centered on an imperial court in heijō-kyō modern nara the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture the smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japan's population in 784 emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-kyō before relocating it to heian-kyō modern kyoto in 794

about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world
the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago

the climate of japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: hokkaido sea of japan central highland seto inland sea pacific ocean and ryūkyū islands the northernmost zone hokkaido has a humid continental climate with long cold winters and very warm to cool summers precipitation is not heavy but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter
in the sea of japan zone on honshu's west coast northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall in the summer the region is cooler than the pacific area though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn wind the central highland has a typical inland humid continental climate with large temperature differences between summer and winter and between day and night precipitation is light though winters are usually snowy the mountains of the chūgoku and shikoku regions shelter the seto inland sea from seasonal winds bringing mild weather year-round
the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers precipitation is very heavy especially during the rainy season
the average winter temperature in japan is 5.1 °c 41.2 °f and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °c 77.4 °f the highest temperature ever measured in japan 40.9 °c 105.6 °f was recorded on august 16 2007 the main rainy season begins in early may in okinawa and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching hokkaido in late july in most of honshu the rainy season begins before the middle of june and lasts about six weeks in late summer and early autumn typhoons often bring heavy rain
japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands they range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the ryūkyū and bonin islands to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands to temperate coniferous forests in the cold winter portions of the northern islands japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife including the brown bear the japanese macaque the japanese raccoon dog the large japanese field mouse and the japanese giant salamander a large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven ramsar wetland sites four sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list for their outstanding natural value

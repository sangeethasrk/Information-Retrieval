desertec - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
desertec was a large scale project supported by a foundation of the same name and the consortium dii desertec industrial initiative created in germany as a limited liability company gmbh the project aimed at creating a global renewable energy plan based on the concept of harnessing sustainable power from sites where renewable sources of energy are more abundant and transferring it through high-voltage direct current transmission to consumption centers all kinds of renewable energy sources are envisioned but the sun-rich deserts of the world play a special role
there are some parallels between desertec and the atlantropa project plan in the 1920s atlantropa aimed to integrate europe and northern africa and its electricity grid based on a giant hydro power station at gibraltar
the runtime of the project preparations saw a significant enhancement of the role of renewable energies in the middle east and north africa however by 2014 47 of the 50 initial shareholders had left the consortium which will be continued on a much smaller scale


desertec was developed by the trans-mediterranean renewable energy cooperation trec a voluntary organization founded in 2003 by the club of rome and the national energy research center jordan made up of scientists and experts from across europe the middle east and north africa eu-mena it is from this network that the desertec foundation later emerged as a non-profit organization tasked with promoting the desertec solution around the world founding members of the foundation are the german association of the club of rome members of the network of scientists trec as well as committed private supporters and long-time promoters of the desertec idea in 2009 the desertec foundation founded the munich-based industrial initiative 'dii gmbh' together with partners from the industrial and finance sectors its task is to accelerate the implementation of the desertec concept in the focus region eu-mena
the scientific studies done by the german aerospace center dlr between 2004 and 2007 demonstrated that the desert sun could meet rising power demand in the mena region while also helping to power europe reduce carbon emissions across the eu-mena region and power desalination plants to provide freshwater to the mena region dii gmbh published a further study called desert power 2050 in june 2012 it found that the mena region would be able to meet its needs for power with renewable energy while exporting its excess power to create an export industry with an annual volume of more than €60 billion meanwhile by importing desert power europe could save around €30 mwh
by taking into account land and water use desertec intended to offer an integrated solution to food and water shortages
atlantropa was a gigantic engineering project devised by herman sörgel in the 1920s and promulgated by him until his death in 1952 its central feature was a hydroelectric dam to be built across the strait of gibraltar which would have provided enormous amounts of hydroelectricity for the whole mediterranean region and lowered the surface of the mediterranean sea by up to 200 metres 660 ft opening up large new lands for settlement the project reached great popularity in the late 1920s and early 1930s and for a short period again in the late 1940s and early 1950s but was forgotten after sörgel's death 1952
the overall technocratic approach to strengthen political unity across the mediterranean sea via a large-scale infrastructure project has some parallels to desertec as well some technical aspects as the idea of fostering a cross-border electricity grid in the region a major difference lies in the stepwise approach taken by desertec which took previous failures of large-scale technical visions into account atlantropa relied on a single large-scale infrastructure and was never despite its longstanding popularity close to technical realization desertec was led by a similar macro-engineering vision but attempted to start via small-scale steps which at least partially succeeded
the desertec concept was originated with dr gerhard knies a german particle physicist and founder of the trans-mediterranean renewable energy cooperation trec network of researchers in 1986 in the wake of the chernobyl nuclear accident he was searching for a potential alternative source of clean energy and arrived at the following remarkable conclusion: in just six hours the world's deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes in a year the desertec concept was developed further by trec – an international network of scientists experts and politicians from the field of renewable energies – founded in 2003 by the club of rome and the national energy research center jordan one of the most famous members was prince hassan bin talal of jordan in 2009 trec emerged to the non-profit desertec foundation
the desertec foundation was founded on 20 january 2009 with the aim of promoting the implementation of the desertec concept for clean power from deserts all over the world it is a non-profit organisation with offices in hamburg and heidelberg the founding members were the german association of the club of rome members of the trec network of scientists as well as committed private supporters and long-time promoters of the desertec idea
the desertec foundation had two directors: dr thiemo gropp a german physicist and co-founder of the desertec foundation and dr ignacio campino a chilean ecologist and former board representative for sustainability and climate protection at deutsche telekom
with around 30 staff members and country coordinators and a large global community of supporters the foundation tried to accelerate the implementation of the desertec concept by:
to help accelerate the implementation of the desertec idea in eu-mena the non-profit desertec foundation and a group of 12 european companies led by munich re founded an industrial initiative called dii gmbh in munich on 30 october 2009 the other companies included deutsche bank eon rwe abengoa like the desertec foundation dii gmbh did not intend to build power plants itself instead it focused on four core objectives in eu-mena:
dii gmbh aimed to create a positive investment climate for renewable energies and interconnected power grid in north africa and the middle east by encouraging the necessary technological economic political and frameworks this included the development of a long-term implementation concept called desert power 2050 with guidance on investment and funding dii gmbh has initiated selected reference projects to demonstrate overall feasibility and reduce system overall costs
on 24 november 2011 a memorandum of understanding mou was signed between the medgrid consortium and dii to study design and promote an interconnected electrical grid linking desertec and the medgrid projects the medgrid together with desertec would serve as the backbone of the european super grid and the benefits of investing in hvdc technology are being assessed to reach the final goal – the supersmart grid the activities of dii and medgrid were covered by the mediterranean solar plan msp a political initiative within the framework of the union for the mediterranean ufm
the company was formed by the desertec foundation and a consortium of worldwide companies
as of march 2014 dii consisted of 20 shareholders listed below and 17 associate partners
managing director of dii gmbh has been paul van son a senior international energy manager end of 2014 most shareholders terminated their contract with dii after it had accomplished its initial mission rwe state grid corporation of china and acwa power stayed on board to drive the new mission of dii: to facilitate the rapid deployment of utility-scale renewable energy projects in desert areas and to integrate them in the interconnected power systems
desertec is a global renewable energy solution based on harnessing sustainable power from the sites where renewable sources of energy are at their most abundant these sites can be used thanks to low-loss high-voltage direct current transmission all kinds of renewables will be used in the desertec concept but the sun-rich deserts of the world play a special role
the original and first region for the assessment and application of this concept is the eu-mena region european union middle east and northern africa the desertec organisations promote the generation of electricity in north africa the middle east and europe using renewable sources such as solar power plants wind parks and develop a euro-mediterranean electricity network primarily made up of high voltage direct current hvdc transmission cables despite its name desertec's proposal would see most of the power plants located outside of the sahara desert itself but rather in the surrounding areas in the more accessible north and south steppes and woodlands as well as the relatively moist atlantic coastal desert under the desertec proposal concentrating solar power systems photovoltaic systems and wind parks would be spread over the wide desert regions in north africa like the sahara desert and all his subdivisions the generated electricity would be transmitted to european and african countries by a super grid of high-voltage direct current cables it would provide a considerable part of the electricity demand of the mena countries and furthermore provide continental europe with 15% of its electricity needs exported desert power would complement europe's transition to renewables which would be based primarily on harnessing domestic sources of energy that would increase its energy independence according to a scenario by the german aerospace center dlr by 2050 investments into solar plants and transmission lines would be total €400 billion an exact proposal how to realize this scenario including technical and financial requirements will be designed by 2012 2013 see desert power 2050
in march 2012 the desertec foundation started working in a further focus region a year after the nuclear disaster in fukushima the desertec foundation and the japan renewable energy foundation jref have signed a mou they will exchange knowledge and know-how and coordinate their work together to develop suitable framework conditions for the deployment of renewables and to establish transnational cooperation in greater east asia the aim is to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in asia to provide secure and sustainable alternatives to fossil and nuclear power as a part of its mission jref promotes the asia super grid initiative to facilitate an electricity system based fully on renewable energy the desertec foundation sees such a grid as an important step towards the implementation of desertec in greater east asia and has already conducted a feasibility study on potential grid corridors to make best use of the region’s desert sun
the desertec concept was developed by an international network of politicians academics and economists called trec the research institutes for renewable sources of the governments of morocco cder algeria neal libya cses egypt nrea jordan nerc and yemen universities of sana'a and aden as well as the german aerospace center dlr made significant contributions towards the development of the desertec concept the basic studies relating to desertec were led by dlr scientist dr franz trieb working for the institute for technical thermodynamics at the dlr the three studies were funded by the german federal ministry for the environment nature conservation and nuclear safety bmu the studies conducted between 2004 and 2007 evaluated the following as shown in the table below
the studies concluded that the extremely high solar radiation in the deserts of north africa and the middle east outweighs the 10–15% transmission losses between the desert regions and europe this means that solar thermal power plants in the desert regions are more economical than the same kinds of plants in southern europe the german aerospace center has calculated that if solar thermal power plants were to be constructed in large numbers in the coming years the estimated cost of electricity would come down from 0.09–0.22 euro kwh to about 0.04–0.05 euro kwh
the sahara desert was chosen as an ideal location for solar farms as it is exposed to bright sunshine nearly all the time roughly between 80% and 97% of the daylight hours in the best cases this is the sunniest year-round area on the planet in the world's largest hot desert there is an extremely vast area covering almost the whole desert that receives more than 3,600 h of yearly sunshine there is also a very large area in excess of 4,000 h of sunshine annually the highest solar radiation received on the planet is in the sahara desert under the tropic of cancer this results from a general strong lack of cloud cover year-round and a geographical position under the tropics
the annual average insolation which represents the total amount of solar radiation energy received on a given area and on a giver period is about 2,500 kwh m² year over the region and this number can soar up to almost 3,000 kwh m² year in the best cases the weather features of the sahara desert especially the insolation have a pronounced nature the annual electricity production reaches 1,300,000 twh at maximum in this sun-drenched area if the whole desert is covered in solar panels the desert is also extremely vast covering about some 9,000,000 km² 3,474,920 sq mi being almost as large as china or the united states and is sparsely populated making it possible to set up large solar farms without a negative impact on inhabitants of the region too lastly sand deserts can provide silicon a raw material that is essential in the production of solar panels
the great african desert is relatively cloud-free all year long but it's important to note the harsh desert climate also has some negative features such as extreme heat and sometimes dust or sand-laden winds which frequently blow over the desert and can even result in severe duststorms or sandstorms both phenomenons reduce the solar electricity productivity and the efficiency of the solar panels
dii announced it will introduce a roll-out-plan in late 2012 which includes concrete recommendations how to enable investments in renewable energy and interconnected power grids dii claims working with all key stakeholders from the international scientific and business communities as well as policy-makers and civil society to enable two or three concrete reference projects to demonstrate the feasibility of the long-term vision dii developed a strategic framework for a fully integrated and decarbonized power system based on renewable energies for the entire north africa middle east and europe eumena region in 2050 therefore dii researched from the viewpoint of technology and geography what is the optimal mix of renewable energies to provide the eumena region with sustainable energy in july 2012 dii presented the first part of its study “desert power 2050 – perspectives on a sustainable power system for eumena
key findings desert power 2050 demonstrates that the abundance of sun and wind in the eumena region will enable the creation of a joint power network that will entail more than 90 percent renewables according to the study such a joint power network involving north africa the middle east and europe eumena offers clear benefits to all involved the nations of the middle east and north africa mena could meet their expanding needs for power with renewable energy while developing an export industry from their excess power with could reach an annual volume worth more than 60 billion euros according to the study results by importing up to 20 percent of its power from the deserts europe could save up to 30 euros for each megawatt hour of desert power
the north and south would become the powerhouses of this joint network supported by wind and hydropower in scandinavia as well as wind and solar energy in the mena region supply and demand would complement one other – both regionally and seasonally – according to the findings of desert power 2050 with its constant supply of wind and solar energy throughout the year the mena region can cover europe's energy needs without the latter having to build costly excess capacities a further benefit of the power network is the enhanced security of supply to all nations concerned a renewables based network would lead to mutual reliance among the countries involved complemented by inexpensive imports from the south and the north
methodology desert power 2050 presents the full perspective of the eumena region which includes for instance the growing consumption of power in the mena states the power requirements of the mena states are likely to more than quadruple by 2050 totalling more than 3000 terawatt hours unlike in europe the population will also grow considerably by the middle of the century thus heightening the demand for new jobs analysing the design of a power system built to include more than 90% renewables 40 years into the future is necessarily subject to major uncertainties on a range of assumptions to address these uncertainties dii analysed so-called sensitivities or perspectives to show how the results react to changed parameters dii has analysed a total of 18 perspectives on the eumena power supply in 2050 they cover a wide range of major impact factors on the attractiveness of power system integration the main message of the study: grid integration across the mediterranean is valuable under all foreseeable circumstances
second phase desert energy could be a stimulus for growth and make an important contribution when it comes to coping with the social and economic challenges in north africa and the middle east dii announced that a second phase of desert power 2050 getting started will examine this topic in greater depth in the next few months with discussions including political scientific and industrial stakeholders the objective is to formulate recommendations for the regulatory steps required in the years to come
more energy falls on the world's deserts in six hours than the world consumes in a year and the saharan desert is virtually uninhabited and is close to europe supporters say that the project will keep europe at the forefront of the fight against climate change and help north african and european economies to grow within greenhouse gas emission limits desertec officials say the project could one day deliver 15 percent of europe's electricity and a considerable part of mena's electricity demand according to the desertec foundation the project has strong job creation potential and could improve the stability in the region according to the report by wuppertal institute for climate environment and energy and the club of rome the project could create 240,000 german jobs and generate €2 trillion worth of electricity by 2050
concentrated solar power also called concentrating solar power and csp systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight or solar thermal energy onto a small area electrical power is produced when the concentrated light is converted to heat which drives a heat engine usually a steam turbine connected to an electrical power generator molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night since solar fields feed their heat energy into a conventional generation unit with a steam turbine they can be combined without any problem with fossil fuel hybrid power plants this hybridization secures energy supply also in unfavourable weather and at night without the need of accelerating costly compensatory plants a technical challenge is the cooling which is necessary for every heating power system dii is therefore reliant either on an adequate water supply coastal facilities or improved cooling technology
dii also considers photovoltaics as a technology suitable for desert power plants photovoltaics is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon polycrystalline silicon amorphous silicon cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide sulfide driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured
in 2010 first solar – a producer of thin film solar panels joined dii as associated partner the us based company already has experience with huge pv installations and has constructed the 550 megawatt desert sunlight solar farm and topaz solar farm in california which are the biggest two pv installations of the world
as also parts of the desert regions in the middle east and north africa mena come with high wind potential dii is examining in which geographic regions the installation of wind farms is suitable wind turbines produce electricity by wind turning the blades which spin a shaft which connects to a generator which produces electricity the sahara desert is one of the windiest areas on the planet especially on the western coast where lies the atlantic coastal desert along western sahara and mauritania the annual average wind speed at the ground greatly exceeds 5 m s in most of the desert and even approach 8 m s or 9 m s along the western ocean coast it's important to note that wind speed increases with height the regularity and the constancy of winds in arid regions are major assets for wind energy too the winds blow nearly constantly over the desert and there are generally no windless days during throughout the year therefore the desert of north africa is also an ideal location to install large-scale wind parks and wind turbines with very good productivity
to export renewable energy produced in the mena desert region a high-voltage direct current hvdc electric power transmission system is needed high voltage dc hvdc technology is a proven and economical method of power transmission over very long distances and also a trusted method to connect asynchronous grids or grids of different frequencies with hvdc energy can also be transported in both directions for long-distance transmission hvdc suffers lower electrical losses than alternating current ac transmission because of the higher solar radiation in mena the production of energy even with the included transmissions losses is still advantageous over the production in south europe
also very long distance projects have already been realized with technological cooperation from abb and siemens – both shareholders of dii namely the 800 kv hvdc xiangjiaba-shanghai transmission system which was commissioned by state grid corporation of china sgcc in june 2010 the hvdc link is the most powerful and longest transmission of its kind to be implemented anywhere in the world and at the time of commissioning transmitted 6,400 mw of power over a distance of nearly 2,000 kilometres this is longer than would be needed to link mena and europe siemens energy has equipped the sending converter station fulong for this link with ten dc converter transformers including five rated at 800 kv
the second hvdc project which is also for sgcc with cooperation from abb is a new hvdc link of 3,000 mw over 920 kilometres from hulunbeir in inner mongolia to shenyang in the province of liaoning in the north-eastern part of china in 2010 another project scheduled for 2014 commissioning – is the construction of an ±800 kv north-east uhvdc link from the north-eastern and eastern region of india to the city of agra across a distance of 1,728 kilometres
another project of this type is the rio madeira hvdc system a hvdc link of 2,375 kilometres 1,476 mi

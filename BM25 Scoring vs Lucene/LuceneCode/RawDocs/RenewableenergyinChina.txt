renewable energy in china - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
in 2013 china led the world in renewable energy production with a total capacity of 378 gw mainly from hydroelectric and wind power as of 2014 china leads the world in the production and use of wind power solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies generating almost as much water wind and solar energy as all of france and germany's power plants combined in 2016 china became world's largest producer of photovoltaic power at 43 gw installed capacity china’s renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity since 2005 production of solar cells in china has expanded 100-fold as chinese renewable manufacturing has grown the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped dramatically innovation has helped but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion
china sees renewables as a source of energy security not just of carbon emission reductions issued by china’s state council in september 2013 china’s action plan for the prevention and control of air pollution illustrates government desire to increase the share of renewables in china’s energy mix unlike oil coal and gas the supplies of which are finite and subject to geopolitical tensions renewable energy systems can be built and used wherever there is sufficient water wind and sun


on april 6 2007 the gansu dang river hydropower project was registered as a clean development mechanism cdm project in accordance with the requirements of the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the project consists of the construction and operation of eight run-of-river hydropower plants providing total capacity of 35.4 gw which will generate an average of 224 gwh year the project is located in dang town subei mongolian autonomous county gansu province china and was certified by the national development and reform commission ndrc to be in compliance with the measures for the operation and management of clean development mechanism projects in china the power generated by the project will be sold to the gansu power grid which is part of the china northwest regional power grid nwpg this will displace equivalent amounts of electricity generated by the current mix of power sold to the nwpg the developer of the gansu dang river hydropower project which started construction on november 1 2004 is the jiayuguan city tongyuan hydropower co ltd the letter of approval of the ndrc permits the jiayuguan city tongyuan hydropower co ltd to transfer to japan carbon finance ltd an entity approved by the government of japan no more than 1.2 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions in total certified emission reductions cers over the seven-year period beginning on may 1 2007 and ending on april 30 2014
in 2006 there were 10 gw of installed hydropower capacity that went into operation in china the national development and reform commission also approved thirteen additional hydropower projects in 2006 which cumulatively will have 19.5 gw of power generating capacity new hydropower projects that were approved and began construction in 2006 include the jinsha river xiangjiaba dam 6000 mw the yalong river second phase 4800 mw the lancang river's jinghong dam 1750 mw the beipan river1040 mw and the wu river's silin dam 1080 mw in 2005 the following hydroelectric power projects were approved by the ndrc and began construction: the jinsha river's xiluo crossing 12600 mw the yellow river's laxiwa dam 4200 mw and the yalong river first phase 3600 mw
china has the largest wind resources in the world and three-quarters of its wind farms are offshore in 2008 china was the fourth largest producer of wind power after the united states germany and spain at the end of 2008 wind power in china accounted for 12.2 gw of electricity generating capacity while in 2009 china had total installed windpower capacity up to 26 gw china has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country's economy as of 2010 china has become the world's largest maker of wind turbines surpassing denmark germany spain and the united states
by the end of 2008 at least fifteen chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components turbine sizes of 1.5 mw and 2 mw became common leading wind power companies were goldwind dongfang and sinovel china also increased the production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines 80 mw in 2008 through all these developments the chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the global financial crisis according to industry observers
the initial future target set by the chinese government was 10 gw by 2010 but the total installed capacity for wind power generation in china had already reached 25.1 gw by the end of 2009 china aims to have 100 gw of wind power capacity by 2020 china encourages foreign companies especially from the united states to visit and invest in chinese wind power generation however use of wind energy in china has not always kept up with the remarkable construction of wind power capacity in the country
china produces 63% of the world's solar photovoltaics pv it has emerged as the world's largest manufacturer as of june 2015
china has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over $15 billion around 820 mw of solar pv were produced in china in 2007 second only to japan
following the new incentive scheme of golden sun announced by the government in 2009 there are numerous recent developments and plans announced by industry players that became part of the milestones for solar industry and technology development in china such as the new thin film solar plant developed by anwell technologies in the henan province using its own proprietary solar technology the agreement was signed by ldk for a 500 mw solar project in the desert alongside first solar and ordos city the effort to drive the renewable energy use in china was further assured after the speech of the chinese president given at the un climate summit on 22 september 2009 in new york pledging that china would adopt plans to use 15% of its energy from renewable sources within a decade
about 50 mw of installed solar capacity was added in 2008 more than double the 20 mw capacity of 2007 according to some studies the demand in china for new solar modules could be as high as 232 mw each year from now on until 2012 china added an estimated 5 gw of capacity in 2012 the government has announced plans to expand the installed capacity to 20 gw by 2020 if chinese companies manage to develop low cost reliable solar modules then the sky is the limit for a country that is desperate to reduce its dependence on coal and oil imports as well as the pressure on its environment by using renewable energy
china emerged as the world's third largest producer of ethanol-based bio-fuels after the us and brazil at the end of the 10th five year plan period in 2005 and at present ethanol accounts for 20% of total automotive fuel consumption in china in the 11th five year plan period 2006 through 2010 china planned to develop six megatons year of fuel ethanol capacity which is expected to grow to 15 megatons year by 2020 despite this level of production experts say that there will be no threat to food security though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be farming oil if the price of crude oil continues to increase based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in china the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for plants in these provinces in the recently published world economic outlook the international monetary fund expressed concern that there would be increasing competition worldwide between bio-fuels and food consumption for agricultural products and that that competition would likely continue to result in increases in the price of crops
work has begun on the ¥250 million kaiyou green energy biomass rice husks power generating project located in the suqian city economic development zone in jiangsu province the kaiyou green energy biomass power project will generate 144 gwh year and use 200 kilotons year of crop waste as inputs
bioenergy is also used at the domestic level in china both in biomass stoves and by producing biogas from animal manure
geothermal resources in china are abundant and widely distributed throughout the country there are over 2,700 hot springs occurring at the surface with temperatures exceeding 250°c in 1990 the total flow rate of thermal water for direct uses amounted to over 9,500 kg s making china the second direct user of geothermal energy in the world recognizing geothermal energy as an alternative and renewable energy resource since the 1970s china has conducted extensive explorations aiming at identifying high temperature resources for electric generation until 2006 181 geothemal systems had been found on mainland china with an estimated generation potential of 1,740 mw however only seven plants with a total capacity of 32 mw had been constructed and were operating in 2006
after the dissolution of the energy and industry department in 1993 china has been running without a government agency effectively managing the country's energy related issues are supervised by multiple organizations such as the national development and reform commission ndrc ministry of commerce state electricity regulatory commission serc and so forth in 2008 the national energy administration was founded under the ndrc however its work has been proven inefficient in january 2010 the state council decided to set up a national energy commission nec headed by current chinese premier wen jiabao the commission will be responsible for drafting a national energy development plan reviewing energy security and major energy issues and coordinating domestic energy development and international cooperation
the chinese government is implementing multiple policies to promote renewable energy from 2008 to january 2012 china held the top spot in clean energy investment the renewable energy law passed in 2005 explicitly states in its first chapter that the development and the usage of renewable energy is a prioritized area in energy development the twelfth five-year plan the current plan also places great emphasis on green energy detailed incentive policies and programs include the golden sun program which provides financial subsidies technology support and market incentives to facilitate the development of the solar power industry the suggestions on promoting wind electricity industry in 2006 which offers preferential policies for wind power development and many other policies besides promoting policies china has enacted a number of policies to standardize renewable energy products to prevent environmental damage and to regulate the price of green energy these policies include but are not limited to renewable energy law the safety regulations of hydropower dams and the national standard of solar water heaters
several provisions in relevant chinese laws and regulations address the development of methane gas in rural china these provisions include article 54 of the agriculture law of the people's republic of china articles 4 and 11 of the energy conservation law of the people's republic of china article 18 of the renewable energy law of the people's republic of china and article 12 of the regulations of the people's republic of china concerning restoring farmland to forest

according to china's energy blue paper recently written by the chinese academy of social sciences the average rate of recovery of coal from mining in china is only 30% less than one-half the rate of recovery throughout the world the rate of recovery of coal resources in the us australia germany and canada is ~80% the rate of recovery of coal from mining in shanxi province china's largest source of coal is approximately 40% though the rate of recovery of village and township coal mines in shanxi province is only 10%-20% cumulatively over the course of the past 20 years 1980–2000 china has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal the same causes for a low rate of recovery in coal mining—that extraction methods are backwards—lead to safety problems in china's coal mining sector another reason for the low rate of recovery is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by china only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current rate of recovery of 30% if china were able to double its rate of recovery it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal

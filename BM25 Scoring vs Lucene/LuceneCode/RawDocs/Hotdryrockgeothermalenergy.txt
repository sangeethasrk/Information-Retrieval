hot dry rock geothermal energy - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
hot dry rock hdr is by far the most abundant source of geothermal energy available to mankind a vast store of thermal energy is contained in the hot—but essentially dry—impervious crystalline basement rocks found almost everywhere deep beneath the earth’s surface a concept for the extraction of useful amounts of geothermal energy from hdr originated at the los alamos national laboratory in 1970 and was so groundbreaking that laboratory researchers were awarded a us patent covering it


although often confused with the relatively limited hydrothermal resource already commercialized to a large extent hdr geothermal energy is very different whereas hydrothermal energy production can only exploit hot fluids already in place in the earth’s crust an hdr system consisting of the pressurized hdr reservoir the boreholes drilled from the surface and the surface injection pumps and associated plumbing recovers the earth’s heat from hot but dry regions via the closed-loop circulation of pressurized fluid this fluid injected from the surface under high pressure opens pre-existing joints in the basement rock thus creating a man-made reservoir that may be as much as a cubic kilometer in size the fluid injected into the reservoir absorbs thermal energy from the high-temperature rock surfaces and then serves as the vehicle for transporting that heat to the surface for practical use
as the reservoir is formed by the pressure-dilation of the joints the elastic response of the surrounding rock mass results in a region of tightly compressed sealed rock at the periphery—making the hdr reservoir totally confined and contained such a reservoir is therefore fully engineered in that the physical characteristics size depth at which it is created as well as the operating parameters injection and production pressures production temperature etc can be pre-planned and closely controlled
as described by brown an hdr geothermal energy system is developed first by using conventional drilling to access a region of deep hot basement rock once it has been determined that the selected region contains no open faults or joints by far the most common situation an isolated section of this first borehole is pressurized at a level high enough to open several sets of previously sealed joints in the rock mass by continuous pumping hydraulic stimulation a very large region of stimulated rock is created the hdr reservoir that consists of an interconnected array of joint flow paths within the rock mass the opening of these flow paths causes movement along the pressure-activated joints generating seismic signals microearthquakes analysis of these signals yields information about the location and dimensions of the reservoir being developed
typically an hdr reservoir forms in the shape of an ellipsoid with its longest axis orthogonal to the least principal earth stress this pressure-stimulated region is then accessed by two production wells drilled to intersect the hdr reservoir near the elongated ends of the stimulated region in most cases the initial borehole becomes the injection well for the three-well pressurized water-circulating system
in operation fluid is injected at pressures high enough to hold open the interconnected network of joints against the earth stresses and to effectively circulate fluid through the hdr reservoir at a high rate during routine energy production the injection pressure is maintained at just below the level that would cause further pressure-stimulation of the surrounding rock mass in order to maximize energy production while limiting further reservoir growth
the volume of the newly created array of opened joints within the hdr reservoir is much less than 1% of the volume of the pressure-stimulated rock mass as these joints continue to pressure-dilate the overall flow impedance across the reservoir becomes very low leading to a high thermal productivity
the feasibility of mining heat from the deep earth was proven in two separate hdr reservoir flow demonstrations—each involving about one year of circulation—conducted by the los alamos national laboratory between 1978 and 1995 these groundbreaking tests took place at the laboratory’s fenton hill hdr test site in the jemez mountains of north-central new mexico at depths of over 8000 ft and rock temperatures in excess of 180 °c the results of these tests demonstrated conclusively the viability of the revolutionary new hdr geothermal energy concept the two separate reservoirs created at fenton hill are still the only truly confined hdr geothermal energy reservoirs flow-tested anywhere in the world
as we see it—on the basis of over 40 years of geothermal experience—the term hot dry rock refers to the vast regions of hot sealed basement rock found at depth throughout the earth's crust in contrast the term egs enhanced geothermal systems should be restricted to the pressure-stimulation of pre-existing joints or faults within or at the periphery of hydrothermal regions where water is already present which are far fewer and smaller in 1992 the japanese suggested the term hwr hot wet rock for these open ie unconfined pressure-stimulated geothermal systems
there have been numerous reports of the testing of unconfined geothermal systems pressure-stimulated in crystalline basement rock: for instance at the rosemanowes quarry in cornwall england at the hijiori and ogachi calderas in japan at the faulted soultz-sous-forêts “hdr” system in france and in the cooper basin australia however all these “engineered” geothermal systems while developed under programs directed toward the investigation of hdr technologies have proven to be open—as evidenced by the high water losses observed during pressurized circulation in essence they are all egs or hydrothermal systems not true hdr reservoirs
the egs concept was first described by los alamos researchers in 1990 at a geothermal symposium sponsored by the united states department of energy doe—many years before the doe coined the term egs in an attempt to emphasize the geothermal aspect of heat mining rather than the unique characteristics of hdr
the first hdr reservoir tested at fenton hill the phase i reservoir was created in june 1977 and then flow-tested for 75 days from january to april 1978 at a thermal power level of 4 mw the final water loss rate at a surface injection pressure of 900 psi was 2 gpm 2% of the injection rate this initial reservoir was shown to essentially consist ofa single pressure-dilated near-vertical joint with a vanishingly small flow impedance of 0.5 psi gpm
the initial phase i reservoir was enlarged in 1979 and further flow-tested for almost a year in 1980.14 of greatest importance this flow test confirmed that the enlarged reservoir was also confined and exhibited a low water loss rate of 6 gpm this reservoir consisted of the single near-vertical joint of the initial reservoir which as noted above had been flow-tested for 75 days in early 1978augmented by a set of newly pressure-stimulated near-vertical joints that were somewhat oblique to the strike of the original joint
a deeper and hotter hdr reservoir phase ii was created during a massive hydraulic fracturing mhf operation in late 1983 it was first flow-tested in the spring of 1985 by an initial closed-loop flow test icft that lasted a little over a month information garnered from the icft provided the basis for a subsequent long-term flow test ltft carried out from 1992 to 1995
the ltft comprised several individual steady-state flow runs interspersed with numerous additional experiments in 1992–1993 two steady-state circulation periods were implemented the first for 112 days and the second for 55 days during both tests water was routinely produced at a temperature of over 180 °c and a rate of 90–100 gpm resulting in continuous thermal energy production of approximately 4 mw over this time span the reservoir pressure was maintained even during shut-in periods at a level of about 15 mpa
beginning in mid-1993 the reservoir was shut in for a period of nearly two years and the applied pressure was allowed to drop to essentially zero in

tragedy of the commons - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently and rationally according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource
the concept and name originate in an essay written in 1833 by the victorian economist william forster lloyd who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land then colloquially called the commons in the british isles the concept became widely-known over a century later due to an article written by the ecologist garrett hardin in 1968 in this context commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere oceans rivers fish stocks or even an office refrigerator
the tragedy of the commons is often cited in connection with sustainable development meshing economic growth and environmental protection as well as in the debate over global warming it has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of economics evolutionary psychology anthropology game theory politics taxation and sociology
although commons have been known to collapse due to overuse such as in over-fishing many examples exist which prosper without collapse the political economist elinor ostrom stated that it is often claimed that only private ownership or government regulation can prevent the tragedy however it is in the interests of the users of a commons to keep it running and complex social schemes are often devised by them for maintaining common resources efficiently


in 1833 the english economist william forster lloyd published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource this was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze as was the custom in english villages he postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common overgrazing could result for each additional animal a herder could receive additional benefits but the whole group shared damage to the commons if all herders made this individually rational economic decision the common could be depleted or even destroyed to the detriment of all
in 1968 ecologist garrett hardin explored this social dilemma in his article the tragedy of the commons published in the journal science the essay derived its title from the pamphlet by lloyd which he cites on the over-grazing of common land
hardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means as distinct from those with solutions that require a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality hardin focused on human population growth the use of the earth's natural resources and the welfare state hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone and not on the relationship of society and man then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom hardin says that if the children of improvident parents starved to death if overbreeding was its own punishment then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families hardin blamed the welfare state for allowing the tragedy of the commons where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right malthusian catastrophe is inevitable hardin lamented this interpretation of the universal declaration of human rights:
the universal declaration of human rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society article 16 it follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself and cannot be made by anyone else
in addition hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others all resources would still eventually be depleted overall hardin argues against relying on conscience as a means of policing commons suggesting that this favors selfish individuals – often known as free riders – over those who are more altruistic in the context of avoiding over-exploitation of common resources hardin concludes by restating hegel's maxim which was quoted by engels freedom is the recognition of necessity he suggests that freedom completes the tragedy of the commons
by recognizing resources as commons in the first place and by recognizing that as such they require management hardin believes that humans can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms
hardin's article was the start of the modern use of commons as a shared resource term as frank van laerhoven & elinor ostrom have stated prior to the publication of hardin’s article on the tragedy of the commons 1968 titles containing the words ‘the commons’ ‘common pool resources’ or ‘common property’ were very rare in the academic literature they go on to say in 2002 barrett and mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology they report that hardin’s 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and the most frequently cited
like lloyd and thomas malthus before him hardin was primarily interested in the problem of human population growth but in his essay he also focused on the use of larger though finite resources such as the earth's atmosphere and oceans as well as pointing out the negative commons of pollution ie instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource a negative commons deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost pollution
as a metaphor the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally the tragedy is not in the word's conventional or theatric sense nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it similarly hardin's use of commons has frequently been misunderstood leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work the tragedy of the unregulated commons
the metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation temporarily or permanently this occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it this in turn causes demand for the resource to increase which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses even if it retains a capacity to recover the rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question the consumptiveness of their uses and the relative robustness of the common
the same concept is sometimes called the tragedy of the fishers because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet
the tragedy of the commons can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as sustainability the commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today such as water forests fish and non-renewable energy sources such as oil and coal
situations exemplifying the tragedy of the commons include the overfishing and destruction of the grand banks the destruction of salmon runs on rivers that have been dammed – most prominently in modern times on the columbia river in the northwest united states and historically in north atlantic rivers – the devastation of the sturgeon fishery – in modern russia but historically in the united states as well – and in terms of water supply the limited water available in arid regions eg the area of the aral sea and the los angeles water system supply especially at mono lake and owens lake
in economics an externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit negative externalities are a well-known feature of the tragedy of the commons for example driving cars has many negative externalities these include pollution carbon emissions and traffic accidents every time 'person a' gets in a car it becomes more likely that 'person z' – and millions of others – will suffer in each of those areas economists often urge the government to adopt policies that internalize an externality
more general examples some alluded to by hardin of potential and actual tragedies include:
a parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host
the idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of virulence or sexual conflict where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings it is also raised as a question in studies of social insects where scientists wish to understand why insect workers do not undermine the common good by laying eggs of their own and causing a breakdown of the society
the idea of evolutionary suicide where adaptation at the level of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons
from an evolutionary point of view the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide us with advanced therapeutic ways
the commons dilemma is a specific class of social dilemma in which people's short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the common good in academia a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it including resource dilemma take-some dilemma and common pool resource
commons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or over-harvest common resources in both the laboratory and field research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational strategic and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons
in game theory which constructs mathematical models for individuals' behavior in strategic situations the corresponding game developed by hardin is known as the commonize costs – privatize profits game cc–pp game
kopelman weber & messick 2002 in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives gender payoff structure uncertainty power and status group size communication causes and frames they organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences stable personality traits and situational factors the environment situational factors include both the task social and decision structure and the perception of the task
empirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables rather than behaving in line with economic incentives people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework an expanded four factor model of the logic of appropriateness suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: what does a person like me identity do rules in a situation like this recognition given this culture group
strategic factors also matter in commons dilemmas one often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource in simultaneous play all people harvest at the same time whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence – first second third etc there is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first – the leaders – are higher than the harvest of those coming later – the followers the interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more with sequential play individuals adopt a first come-first served rule whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations research found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations moreover those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group
much research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that freedom in a commons brings ruin to all one of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task groups prefer leaders who are elected democratic and prototypical of the group and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation a general aversion to autocratic leadership exists although it may be an effective solution possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption
the provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation – for example through installing water and electricity meters in houses selective rewards work provided that they are open to everyone an experimental carpool lane in the netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool the rewards do not have to be tangible in canada utilities considered putting smiley faces on electricity bills of customers below the average consumption of that customer`s neighborhood
articulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of political philosophy in absence of enlightened self-interest some form of authority or federation is needed to solve the collective action problem in a typical example governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining fishing hunting livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach similarly limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons alternatively resource users themselves can cooperate to conserve the resource in the name of mutual benefit another solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability
an opposing idea used by the united nations moon treaty outer space treaty and law of the sea treaty as well as the unesco world heritage convention involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the common heritage of mankind
in hardin's essay he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on mutual coercion mutually agreed upon and result in relinquishing the freedom to breed hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book managing the commons co-written with john a baden he framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the reproductive right to safeguard all other rights several countries have a variety of population control laws in place
political scientist elinor ostrom who was awarded 2009's nobel prize of economics for her work on the issue and others revisited hardin's work in 1999 they found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as hardin maintained since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves for example it was found that a commons in the swiss alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual

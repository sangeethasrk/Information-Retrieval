wind power in denmark - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
denmark was a pioneer in developing commercial wind power during the 1970s and today a substantial share of the wind turbines around the world are produced by danish manufacturers such as vestas and siemens wind power along with many component suppliers wind power produced the equivalent of 42.1% of denmark's total electricity consumption in 2015 increased from 33% in 2013 and 39% in 2014 in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50% by 2020 and to 84% in 2035 denmark had the 6th best energy security in the world in 2014


as concerns over global warming grew in the 1980s denmark found itself with relatively high carbon dioxide emissions per capita primarily due to the coal-fired electrical power plants that had become the norm after the 1973 and 1979 energy crises renewable energy became the natural choice for denmark decreasing both dependence on other countries for energy and global warming pollution denmark adopted a target of cutting carbon emissions by 22% from 1988 levels by 2005 on 29 march 1985 one year before the chernobyl disaster the danes passed a law forbidding the construction of nuclear power plants in the process the danish grassroots movement had a substantial role the danish anti-nuclear movement's ooa smiling-sun logo atomkraft nej tak nuclear power no thanks spread worldwide and the renewable alternatives were promoted by the danish organisation for renewable energy ove
planning of wind power was deliberately streamlined by authorities in order to minimize hurdles
many countries tried to subsidize green technology such as wind power and most failed to make a viable industry the danish system was an exception providing 30% of initial capital cost in the early years which was gradually reduced to zero but still maintaining a feed-in tariff
denmark has relatively modest average wind speeds in the range of 4.9–5.6 m s measured at 10 m height onshore wind resources are highest in the western part of the country and on the eastern islands with coastlines facing south or west the country has very large offshore wind resources and large areas of sea territory with a shallow water depth of 5–15 m where siting is most feasible these sites offer higher wind speeds in the range of roughly 8.5–9.0 m s at 50 m height there have been no major problems from wind variability although there is a temporary problem resulting from the connection of a large bloc of wind power from offshore wind farms to a single point on a weak section of the transmission network the wind resource over denmark was mapped in 1999 by emd international a s and risø national laboratory the mapping was made using a 200 m grid resolution using the models in windpro and wasp the results were validated on more than 1200 wind turbines nationwide
denmark is connected by transmission line to other european countries eg cross-skagerrak at an electricity interconnection level transmission capacity relative to production capacity of 44% and has traditional power plants therefore it does not need to install additional peak-load plants to balance its wind power instead it purchases additional power from its neighbours when necessary with some strengthening of the grid denmark plans to increase wind's share even further to 50% of consumption in 2020 and up to 84% in 2035
danish district heating plants use 100 petajoule year but little of this consumption is from 180mw of electrode boilers installed in powerplants or 37mw of large heat pumps the boilers are only used to soak up the powerplant's own electricity when prices are negative to avoid paying tax expansion of wind powered district heating is calculated to be economically efficient without taxes
analysts expect the cost of wind power to be 30 øre kwh and its handling cost to be 15 øre kwh being lower than coal and natural gas at 55 øre kwh minimum due to their inability to follow load wind power gets a lower price
at the end of 2014 denmark's capacity stands at 4,792 mw
denmark has the highest proportion of wind power in the world with production: in 2015 denmark set 42% of electricity from wind up from the 2014 record of 39% of total power consumption for the month of january 2014 that share was over 61% the month of lowest wind power share was july at 23% however denmark also had 548 mw of solar power 790 mw in late 2015 for 21 december 2013 the wind share was 102% and for 1 hour the share was 135%
in 2005 denmark had installed wind capacity of 3,127 mw which produced 23,810 tj 6.6 tw·h of energy giving an actual average production of 755 mw at a capacity factor of 24% in 2009 denmark's capacity grew to 3,482 mw most of the increase came from the 209 mw horns rev 2 offshore wind farm which was inaugurated on september 17 2009 by crown prince frederik in 2010 capacity grew to 3,752 mw and most of the year's increase came from the rødsand-2 off-shore wind farm in 2014 the largest increase came from the 400 mw anholt wind farm
wind power output reduces spot market prices in general via the merit order effect in 2008 this caused a net reduction of pre-tax electricity prices balancing the increase from the feed-in law
as denmark continues to install additional capacity they continue to set new production records this is a natural consequence of capacity growth on july 9 2015 in the evening unusually strong wind conditions resulted in 116% of national electricity consumption being produced by wind farms and at 3am the next morning at low demand wind production exceeded 140% of current demand
on 22 march 2012 a coalition of parties representing 95% of all members of the danish parliament agreed that the danish state would increase the country's offshore wind capacity by 1,500 mw the 1,500 mw extra capacity will be achieved by constructing the future offshore wind farms horns rev 3 with a capacity of 400 mw in the north sea at 77 øre kwh and kriegers flak with a capacity of 600 mw in the baltic sea close to the borders of germany and sweden kriegers flak will also be used to connect denmark and germany with a 400mw cable through the german baltic 2 offshore wind farm and energinet ordered electrical equipment in early 2016 in addition 6 nearshore wind farms with a total capacity of up to 450 mw will be constructed along with 50 mw of experimental offshore wind farms the first 350 mw were called for tenders in 2015 with a maximum price of 70 øre kwh horns rev 3 is set to be operational in 2019 while kriegers flak and all the nearshore wind farms are set to be fully operational around 2021 eight groups applied for pre-qualification for kriegers flak of which 7 were approved - 3 more than the 4 companies approved to compete for horns rev 3 both having more bidders than the single bidder for anholt
in addition to the offshore projects a further 500 mw additional net capacity of onshore windfarms is expected be constructed until 2020 the 500 mw of additional net capacity is the expected result of the scrapping of 1,300 mw capacity from obsolete wind turbines combined with the simultaneous building of 1,800 mw capacity of modern wind turbines - a process also known as repowering
annual wind power production is currently 2014 equal to about 39% of electricity consumed in denmark the proportion of this that is actually consumed in denmark has been disputed as the considerable hydropower resources of norway and to some extent sweden is used as grid storage with low loss hydropower can rapidly reduce generation whenever wind farms are generating power saving water for later and can export electricity to denmark when wind power output drops this service of timeshifting production and consumption is also found around the world in pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants
denmark is generally a transit country for electricity trade between the much larger markets in norway sweden and germany
for timeshifting trade with norway denmark exports at dkk 157 mwh and imports at dkk 212 mwh the correlation is low between wind power in norway and denmark market price sometimes falls to near or below z

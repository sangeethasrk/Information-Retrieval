renewable energy in asia - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
renewable energy is a viable means of generating energy in asia
for solar power south asia has the ideal combination of both high solar insolation and a high density of potential customers
cheap solar can bring electricity to a major chunk of subcontinent's people who still live off-grid bypassing the need of installation of expensive grid lines also since the costs of energy consumed for temperature control squarely influences a regions energy intensity and with cooling load requirements roughly in phase with the sun's intensity cooling from intense solar radiation could make perfect energy-economic sense in the subcontinent


in bangladesh a number of domestic solar energy systems are in use in houses around the country the use of solar energy on this scale is highly potential and advantageous as more than 60% of areas in the country do not have access to main grid electricity the world bank is backing a program of making solar energy available to wider population in bangladesh as part of the rural electrification and renewable energy development project reredp which subsidizes solar energy systems
a typical 'solar home system' can power two to eight 'low energy' lights plus a socket for tv radio or battery recharging and a mobile telephone charging unit too each system consists of a solar photovoltaic panel mounted on the house roof depending on its size this provides between 40w and 135w of electricity in full sunlight the most common being 50w
grameen shakti is the largest organization installing rural based solar home system shs in bangladesh other companies working on similar solar energy based shs are rural services foundation rsf brac hilfulfujal and so on the model of micro finance based shs is now being copied in other parts of the world as a successful business model
rahimafrooz is a major supplier of high quality solar batteries and other solar components for the program rahimafrooz renewable energy ltd rre has been the pioneer in installing solar powered centralized systems water pumps for irrigation and pure drinking water water heaters street lights and solar-powered telecom solutions to various organizations they are working closely with pertinent government organizations in installing solar powered medical refrigerator that provides emergency live saving medicines in the off-grid rural areas
a company named digital technology is doing research and development of solar pv products like solar billboard lighting mini grid system for irrigation etc
in china there now are six factories producing at least 2 gw year each of monocrystalline poly-crystalline and non-crystalline photovoltaic cells these factories include the ldk solar co wuxi suntech solar energy co ltd which produces approximately 50 mw year of solar cells and photovoltaic modules the yunnan semi-conductor parts plant which manufactures approximately 2 mw year of mono-crystalline cells the baoding yingli solar energy modules plant which manufactures approximately 6 mw year of polycrystalline cells and modules the shanghai jiaoda guofei solar energy battery factory which produces approximately 1 mw year of modules and the shanghai pv science and technology co ltd which produces approximately 5 mw year of modules
china has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over $15 billion around 820 megawatts of solar pv were produced in china in 2007 second only to japan suntech power holdings co based in jiangsu is the world's third- biggest supplier of solar cells
there are some obstacles to the further development of the chinese solar energy sector that china faces these obstacles include the lack of a nationwide comprehensive photovoltaic pv plan the lack of updated facilities and sufficient financial resources to support pv research at research institutes the lack of sufficient facilities and resources at companies manufacturing pv products the failure of companies to be able to produce high quality reliable and low cost pv products and the relatively weak educational and training opportunities in china for pv science and technology
about 50 mw of installed solar capacity was added in 2008 more than double the 20 mw in 2007 but still a relatively small amount according to some studies the demand in china for new solar modules could be as high as 232 mw each year from now on until 2012 the government has announced plans to expand the installed capacity to 1,800 mw by 2020 if chinese companies manage to develop low cost reliable solar modules then the sky is the limit for a country that is desperate to reduce its dependence on coal and oil imports as well as the pressure on its environment by using renewable energy
in 2009 centre to the prc government’s plans is the recently announced golden sun stimulus program under this program the ministry of finance will subsidize half of the total construction costs of an on-grid solar power plant including transmission expenses the ministry of finance will also pay subsidies of up to 70% to develop independent photovoltaic power generating systems in remote regions the strong handed move by the government is meant to encourage more solar projects to increase the current solar power capacity which at 2008 stood at a paltry 40mw as the government targets to increase china’s solar power capacity up to 20gw by 2020 this will provide significant opportunities for solar cell and module manufacturers many of the solar industry players therefore will expect for chances to be benefited from the government programs especially the solar cell manufacturers with the hope of increase in local demand some of the new developments have been going on with this region like anwell technologies limited a singapore listed company having its solar cell manufacturing plant in china has produced its first thin film solar panel with its own developed production lines in september 2009
according to the speech given by the chinese president hu jintao's at the un climate summit held on september 22 2009 in new york china will intensify effort and adopt ambitious plans to plant enough forest to cover an area the size of norway and use 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources within a decade
india is both densely populated and has high solar insolation providing an ideal combination for solar power in india much of the country does not have an electrical grid so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping to begin replacing india's four to five million diesel powered water pumps each consuming about 3.5 kilowatts and off-grid lighting some large projects have been proposed and a 35,000 km² area of the thar desert has been set aside for solar power projects sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100 gigawatts
the indian solar loan programme supported by the united nations environment programme has won the prestigious energy globe world award for sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches particularly in rural areas of south india where the electricity grid does not yet extend
launched in 2003 the indian solar loan programme was a four-year partnership between unep the unep risoe centre and two of india's largest banks the canara bank and syndicate bank
according to development counsellors international dci a united states marketing company india is the second best country after china for business investment united nations environment programme unep has reported that india has seen a 12% increase in investment in the renewable energy sector with an investment of $3.7 billion in 2008 the largest share was asset finance at $3.2 billion which grew by 25% the clean renewable energy includes wind solar biomass and small-hydro projects the major portion of investment has been made in wind energy sector the investment in wind energy sector grew at 17% from $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion
japan currently produces about 10% of

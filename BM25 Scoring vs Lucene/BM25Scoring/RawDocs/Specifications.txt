specification technical standard - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
there are different types of specifications which generally are mostly types of documents forms or orders or relates to information in databases the word specification merely refers to the act of to state explicitly or in detail or to be specific a specification may refer to a type of technical standard the main topic of this page
using the word specification without additional information to what kind of specification you refer to is confusing and considered bad practice within systems engineering
a requirement specification is a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material design product or service
a functional specification is closely related to the requirement specification and may show functional block diagrams
a design or product specification describes the features of the solutions for the requirement specification referring to the designed solution or final produced solution sometimes the term specification is here used in connection with a data sheet or spec sheet this may be confusing a data sheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product as designed and or produced it can be published by a manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products a data sheet is not a technical specification as described in this article
a in-service or maintained as specification specifies the conditions of a system or object after years of operation including the effects of wear and maintenance configuration changes
specifications may also refer to technical standards which may be developed by any of various kinds of organizations both public and private example organization types include a corporation a consortium a small group of corporations a trade association an industry-wide group of corporations a national government including its military regulatory agencies and national laboratories and institutes a professional association society a purpose-made standards organization such as iso or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements it is common for one organization to refer to reference call out cite the standards of another voluntary standards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract


in engineering manufacturing and business it is vital for suppliers purchasers and users of materials products or services to understand and agree upon all requirements a specification is a type of a standard which is often referenced by a contract or procurement document it provides the necessary details about the specific requirements
specifications may be written by government agencies standards organizations astm iso cen dod etc trade associations corporations and others
a product specification does not necessarily prove a product to be correct or useful an item might be verified to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number: this does not by itself indicate that the item is fit for any particular use the people who use the item engineers trade unions etc or specify the item building codes government industry etc have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications specify the correct one enforce compliance and use the item correctly validation of suitability is necessary
sometimes a guide or a standard operating procedure is available to help write and format a good specification a specification might include:
specifications in north america form part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building the guiding master document is the latest edition of masterformat it is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two professional organisations: construction specifications canada and construction specifications institute
while there is a tendency to believe that specs overrule drawings in the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings the actual intent—made explicit in the contract between the owner and the contractor—is for the drawings and specifications to be complementary together providing the information required for a complete facility
the specifications fall into 50 divisions or broad categories of work results involved in construction the divisions are subdivided into sections each one addressing a narrow scope of the construction work for instance firestopping is addressed in section 078400 - firestopping it forms part of division 07 which is thermal and moisture protection division 07 also addresses building envelope and fireproofing work
each section is subdivided into three distinct parts: general products and execution the masterformat system can be successfully applied to residential commercial civil and industrial construction although many architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use archspec which was specifically created for residential projects
specifications can be either performance-based whereby the specifier restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the completed work or prescriptive whereby the specifier indicates specific products vendors and even contractors that are acceptable for each workscope most construction specifications are a combination of performance-based and prescriptive types naming acceptable manufacturers and products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must be met
while north american specifications are usually restricted to broad descriptions of the work european ones can include actual work quantities including such things as area of drywall to be built in square metres like a bill of materials this type of specification is a collaborative effort between a specwriter and a quantity surveyor this approach is unusual in north america where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of both drawings and specifications
although specifications are usually issued by the architect's office specwriting itself is undertaken by the architect and the various engineers or by specialist specwriters specwriting is often a distinct professional trade with professional certifications such as certified construction specifier ccs through the professional organizations noted above specwriters are either employees of or sub-contractors to architects engineers or construction management companies specwriters frequently meet with manufacturers of building materials who seek to have their products specified on upcoming construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the estimates leading to their proposals
in february 2015 archspec went live from arch architects creating homes a nationwide american professional society of architects whose purpose is to improve residential architecture archspec was created specifically for use by licensed architects while designing sfr single family residential architectural projects unlike the more commercial csi 50+ division commercial specifications archspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional divisions plus a division 0 scope & bid forms and division 17 low voltage many architects up to this point did not provide specifications for residential designs which is one of the reasons archspec was created: to fill a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use
specifications in the uk are part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building they are prepared by construction professionals such as architects architectural technologists structural engineers landscape architects and building services engineers they are created from previous project specifications in-house documents or master specifications such as the national building specification nbs the national building specification is owned by the royal institute of british architects riba through their commercial group riba enterprises ribae nbs master specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive and delivered using software functionality that enables specifiers to

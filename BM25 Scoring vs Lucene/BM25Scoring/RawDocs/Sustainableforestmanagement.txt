sustainable forest management - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
sustainable forest management sfm is the management of forests according to the principles of sustainable development sustainable forest management has to keep the balance between three main pillars: ecological economic and socio-cultural successfully achieving sustainable forest management will provide integrated benefits to all ranging from safeguarding local livelihoods to protecting the biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests reducing rural poverty and mitigating some of the effects of climate change
the forest principles adopted at the united nations conference on environment and development unced in rio de janeiro in 1992 captured the general international understanding of sustainable forest management at that time a number of sets of criteria and indicators have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of sfm at the global regional country and management unit level these were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment of the degree to which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice in 2007 the united nations general assembly adopted the non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests the instrument was the first of its kind and reflected the strong international commitment to promote implementation of sustainable forest management through a new approach that brings all stakeholders together


a definition of sfm was developed by the ministerial conference on the protection of forests in europe forest europe and has since been adopted by the food and agriculture organization fao it defines sustainable forest management as:
the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfill now and in the future relevant ecological economic and social functions at local national and global levels and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems
in simpler terms the concept can be described as the attainment of balance – balance between society's increasing demands for forest products and benefits and the preservation of forest health and diversity this balance is critical to the survival of forests and to the prosperity of forest-dependent communities
for forest managers sustainably managing a particular forest tract means determining in a tangible way how to use it today to ensure similar benefits health and productivity in the future forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors – commercial and non-commercial values environmental considerations community needs even global impact – to produce sound forest plans in most cases forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens businesses organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed the tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices
because forests and societies are in constant flux the desired outcome of sustainable forest management is not a fixed one what constitutes a sustainably managed forest will change over time as values held by the public change
criteria and indicators are tools which can be used to conceptualise evaluate and implement sustainable forest management criteria define and characterize the essential elements as well as a set of conditions or processes by which sustainable forest management may be assessed periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion
criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management there are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives which collectively involve more than 150 countries three of the more advanced initiatives are those of the working group on criteria and indicators for the conservation and sustainable management of temperate and boreal forests also called the montreal process forest europe and the international tropical timber organization countries who are members of the same initiative usually agree to produce reports at the same time and using the same indicators within countries at the management unit level efforts have also been directed at developing local level criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management the center for international forestry research the international model forest network and researchers at the university of british columbia have developed a number of tools and techniques to help forest-dependent communities develop their own local level criteria and indicators criteria and indicators also form the basis of third-party forest certification programs such as the canadian standards association’s sustainable forest management standards and the sustainable forestry initiative standard
there appears to be growing international consensus on the key elements of sustainable forest management seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives the seven thematic areas are:
this consensus on common thematic areas or criteria effectively provides a common implicit definition of sustainable forest management the seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the united nations forum on forests and the 16th session of the committee on forestry these thematic areas have since been enshrined in the non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument
on january 5 2012 the montreal process forest europe the international tropical timber organization and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations acknowledging the seven thematic areas endorsed a joint statement of collaboration to improve global forest related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens
the ecosystem approach has been prominent on the agenda of the convention on biological diversity cbd since 1995  the cbd definition of the ecosystem approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in malawi in 1995 known as the malawi principles the definition 12 principles and 5 points of operational guidance were adopted by the fifth conference of parties cop5 in 2000 the cbd definition is as follows
the ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the convention an ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization which encompasses the essential structures processes functions and interactions among organisms and their environment it recognizes that humans with their cultural diversity are an integral component of many ecosystems
sustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the convention on biological diversity in 2004 decision vii 11 of cop7 to be a concrete means of applying the ecosystem approach to forest ecosystems the two concepts sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally socially and economically sustainable and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations in europe the mcpfe and the council for the pan-european biological and landscape diversity strategy peblds jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the ecosystem approach in 2006
growing environmental awareness and consumer demand for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest certification emerge

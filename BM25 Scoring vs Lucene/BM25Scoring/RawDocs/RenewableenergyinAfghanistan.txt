renewable energy in afghanistan - wikipedia the free encyclopedia


afghanistan is a landlocked country located in asia that holds a spot as one of the countries with a smaller ecological footprint as shown in figure one the biocapacity of the country and their ecological footprint have a tendency to be relatively close to one another global footprint network that being said their renewable energy is very important some of the most influential sources have proven to be hydropower  it has been contended at different levels that hydropower may be an easier source of renewable energy for afghanistan than other nations due to their geographical location ahmad & wasiq their mountainous environment facilitates hydro dams and other facets of hydro energy yasah et al the nation however is not entirely independent on their sources of energy they import an annual sum from neighboring countries like tajikistan mainali & silveira another form of renewable energy that afghanistan has been doing is the implementation of biogas amjid et al with the start of biogas communities have begun to feel the benefits beyond that of the environment through capacity building as well amjid et al
renewable energy in afghanistan ranges from biomass hydropower solar wind energy in afghanistan
afghanistan is one of the lowest energy consuming countries in relation to a global standing mainali & silveira with an “ annual average solar insolation varies from 4 to 6.5 kwh m  spread over 300 days of sunshine per year … afghanistan has significant hydro resources with the river catchment area of 677,900 km annual average rainfall of 300 mm and wide spread hilly topography” mainali & silveira p 300 proving that with the right participatory development there is immense potential in the area of renewable energy mainali & silveira
in afghanistan there is “currently only a number of small renewable projects that are undertaken in the country to promote usage of solar water heating and lighting water pumping and micro-hydro through private sector participation” which will all contribute to the number of renewable resources necessary to grown afghanistan sharma p 65 participatory local development is a vital asset to getting initiatives like these off the ground in using participatory methods as a means of advancing initiatives like renewable energy it is important to note that “the idea of participation as empowerment is that the practical experience of being involved in considering options making decisions and taking collective action to fight injustice itself is transformative” white 2011 p 60 1the participation of the people is an important aspect when tackling an issue involving their land and livelihood sharma mainali &silveira
the country continues to feel the effect of the war and the hardships it has endured in the name of it continue to leave scars with “looting and lack of maintenance and spare parts mean that generation capacity is far below the potential level … which in turn is sustainability below the country’s need” ahmad & wasiq p 23 afghanistan is not self sustainable with their use of energy they also have the need to import energy from neighboring countries one particular country that afghanistan imports from is tajikistan it is known that “the three countries also agreed to set up a joint commission to explore possibilities into the transfer of 500 kilo watts of energy from tajikistan to afghanistan and iran” institute for the study of war importing energy is a popular thing among central asian countries adding a deeper level of connectedness between governments and citizens2
traditional biomass energy supplies to 85% of energy demand such as from wood and dung
currently there is a 304 mw installed capacity of electricity generated by hydropower in which 183 mw are in operationthe current system in place in afghanistan though it works well is not without its flaws as yasah et al contend “the common strategy is currently to build micro-hydropower facilities to power single bulbs and maybe a water boiler for the whole community such constructions will not deliver sufficient power for electric ovens etc grid electricity will not stretch out to the rural areas of afghanistan in the near decades” yasah et al p 51 that being said hydropower and hydro energy are some of the best options that are currently in place the geographical location of afghanistan is extremely mountainous which makes the implementation of hydropower an easier choice though not much has been created and implemented yet ahmad & wasiq acknowledging how low afghanistan’s ecological footprint is in terms of their energy consumption talking about a worldwide standpoint it is not a current possibility to have enough energy global footprint international mainali & silveira mainali in fact “the country has 75 billion cubic meters of potentially available renewable water resources are also the main source of recharge for groundwater as precipitation is low in afghanistan” ahmad & wasiq p 2 water has become such a precious commodity across the globe that makes having an abundance of it as a natural resource is a fortunate reality for afghanistan ahmad & wasiq that being said it is also contended that even though these ideas and proposals for hydro energy would work and have positive effects the necessary work that is a project such as hydro energy yasah et al ahmad & wasiq
wind power is not the most commonly used tool in afghanistan for renewable energy though there are vast opportunities it is contended that the areas which would produce the most wind energy and would benefit the most are in western afghanistan and some areas in the northern region as well elliott
biogas can be used in many different countries with the same function and uses the renewable energy sector in afghanistan is strong though has potential to grow through initiatives like biogas amjid et al the “use of biogas produced from anaerobic decomposition of organic material this biogas typically contains equal amounts of ch4 and co2”barrai et al p 391 when biogas is converted in the right way that is when the renewable energy and resource is possible deriving the hydrogen from the waste amjid et al biogas “decompose municipal solid wastes anaerobically 1and landfill gas to energy projects that directly combust the landfill gas are being implemented” barrai et al p 391 the strength of biogas is incredible it has 2been proven that the “biogas energy corridor can work as a good substitute for nearly 70% of the country’s population residing in rural areas installation of plants to bottle the biogas can be additional opportunity the need of a national policy is imperative to bring this technology at farmer’s doorstep” amjid et al p 2833 the renewable energy that this brings is very strong through reducing the carbon footprint of each community immeasurably amjid et al the system of biogas also creates immense potential for capacity building through the community connectedness that goes into the process barrai et al the teamwork is inevitable that comes from this initiative with begins with an exchange of knowledge both shared and new then capacity building can begin to form contributing to resources and market development growing rapidly amjid et al advocacy for all parties is the only way for effective participatory renewable energy to be made borda the united nations environment program unep spoke on the topic when the country program manager of afghanistan had this to say
“unep is pleased to endorse the vision and mission of the biogas consortium afghanistan the majority of the population of afghanistan uses firewood and coal for their cooking and heating needs more sustainable energy options are required … unep has committed to providing higher-level guidance helping the consortium align its activities towards national policies and strategies unep shall also advocate the benefits and studies that arise from the consortiums work in biogas in afghanistan” borda
biocapacity “refers to the capacity of a given biologically productive area to generate an on-going supply of renewable resources and to absorb its spillover wastes unsustainabilit

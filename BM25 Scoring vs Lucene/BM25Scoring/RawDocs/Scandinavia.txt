scandinavia - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
scandinavia  ˌskændᵻˈneɪviə  is a historical and cultural-linguistic region in northern europe characterized by a common ethno-cultural north germanic heritage and mutually intelligible north germanic languages
in english scandinavia usually refers to the three kingdoms of sweden norway and denmark while finland and iceland are sometimes included modern norway and sweden proper  and the north-west part of finland are situated on the scandinavian peninsula whereas modern denmark consists of jutland and the danish islands
the term scandinavia is usually used as a cultural term but in english usage it is occasionally confused with the geographical term scandinavian peninsula which took its name from the cultural-linguistic concept the name scandinavia originally referred vaguely to the formerly danish now swedish region scania the terms scandinavia and scandinavian entered usage in the late 18th century as terms for the three scandinavian countries their germanic majority peoples and associated language and culture being introduced by the early linguistic and cultural scandinavist movement in foreign usage the term scandinavia is sometimes incorrectly taken to also include iceland the faroe islands and finland because of their historical association with the scandinavian countries and the scandinavian peoples and languages however this broader group of countries is officially and commonly known as the nordic countries
the southern and by far most populous regions of scandinavia have a temperate climate scandinavia extends north of the arctic circle but has relatively mild weather for its latitude due to the gulf stream much of the scandinavian mountains have an alpine tundra climate there are many lakes and moraines legacies of the last glacial period which ended about ten millennia ago
the danish norwegian and swedish languages form a dialect continuum and are known as the scandinavian languages—all of which are considered mutually intelligible with one another although danish is considered much closer to norwegian faroese and icelandic sometimes referred to as insular scandinavian languages are intelligible in continental scandinavian languages only to a very limited extent finnish estonian sami languages and several minority languages spoken in western russia are related to each other but are entirely unrelated to the scandinavian languages they do however include several words that have been adopted during the history from the neighboring languages just as swedish spoken in sweden today has borrowed from finnish
the vast majority of the population of scandinavia are scandinavians descended from several north germanic tribes who originally inhabited the southern part of scandinavia who spoke a germanic language that evolved into old norse and who were known as norsemen in the early middle ages the vikings are popularly associated with norse culture the icelanders and the faroese are to a significant extent but not exclusively descended from peoples retrospectively known as scandinavians a small minority of sami people live in the extreme north of scandinavia


in english scandinavia usually refers to denmark norway and sweden some tourist-oriented sources argue for the inclusion of finland and iceland though that broader region is usually known by the countries concerned as norden finnish pohjoismaat icelandic norðurlöndin faroese norðurlond or the nordic countries
the use of the name scandinavia as a convenient general term for the three kingdoms of denmark norway and sweden is fairly recent according to some historians it was adopted and introduced in the eighteenth century at a time when the ideas about a common heritage started to appear and develop into early literary and linguistic scandinavism before this time the term scandinavia was familiar mainly to classical scholars through pliny the elder's writings and was used vaguely for scania and the southern region of the peninsula
as a political term scandinavia was first used by students agitating for pan-scandinavianism in the 1830s the popular usage of the term in sweden denmark and norway as a unifying concept became established in the nineteenth century through poems such as hans christian andersen's i am a scandinavian of 1839 after a visit to sweden andersen became a supporter of early political scandinavism in a letter describing the poem to a friend he wrote: all at once i understood how related the swedes the danes and the norwegians are and with this feeling i wrote the poem immediately after my return: 'we are one people we are called scandinavians'
the clearest example of the use of the term scandinavia as a political and societal construct is the unique position of finland based largely on parts of modern-day finland being one of the four historical lands in the swedish kingdom for hundreds of years thus to much of the world associating finland with all of scandinavia but the creation of a finnish identity is unique in the region in that it was formed in relation to two different imperial models the swedish and the russian as described by the university of jyväskylä based editorial board of the finnish journal yearbook of political thought and conceptual history
the term is often defined according to the conventions of the cultures that lay claim to the term in their own use when a speaker wants to explicitly include finland alongside scandinavia-proper the geographic terms fenno-scandinavia or fennoscandia are sometimes used in english although these terms are hardly if at all used within scandinavia more precisely and subject to no dispute is that finland is included in the broader term 'nordic countries'
various promotional agencies of the nordic countries in the united states such as the american-scandinavian foundation established in 1910 by the danish american industrialist niels poulsen serve to promote market and tourism interests in the region today the five nordic heads of state act as the organization's patrons and according to the official statement by the organization its mission is to promote the nordic region as a whole while increasing the visibility of denmark finland iceland norway and sweden in new york city and the united states the official tourist boards of scandinavia sometimes cooperate under one umbrella such as the scandinavian tourist board the cooperation was introduced for the asian market in 1986 when the swedish national tourist board joined the danish national tourist board to coordinate intergovernmental promotion of the two countries norway's government entered one year later all five nordic governments participate in the joint promotional efforts in the united states through the scandinavian tourist board of north america
while the term scandinavia is commonly used for denmark norway and sweden the term the nordic countries is used unambiguously for denmark norway sweden finland and iceland including their associated territories greenland the faroe islands and the åland islands scandinavia can thus be considered a subset of the nordic countries furthermore the term fennoscandia refers to scandinavia finland and karelia excluding denmark and overseas territories however the usage of this term is restricted to geology when speaking of the fennoscandian shield baltic shield
in addition to the mainland scandinavian countries of:
the nordic countries also consist of:
estonia has applied for membership in the nordic council referring to its cultural heritage and close linguistic links to finland and historical connections to both denmark and sweden although normally estonia is regarded as one of the baltic countries it is similar to the situation of finland around the 1920s as finland was considered to be one of the baltic states as well as it too had emerged from russian domination along with the other three countries under similar circumstances while finnish and estonian are finnic languages latvian and lithuanian are baltic languages
it should be noted that whereas the term scandinavia is relatively straightforward as traditionally relating to the three kingdoms of denmark norway and sweden there exists some ambiguity as regards the ethnic aspect of the concept in the modern era traditionally the term refers specifically to the majority peoples of denmark norway and sweden their states their germanic languages and their culture in the modern era the term will often include minority peoples such as the sami and meänkieli speakers in a political and to some extent cultural sense as they are citizens of scandinavian countries and speak scandinavian languages either as their first or second language however scandinavian is still also seen as an ethnic term for the germanic majority peoples of scandinavia and as such the inclusion of sami and finnish speakers can be seen as controversial within these groups
scandinavia and scania skåne the southernmost province of sweden are considered to have the same etymology both terms are thought to go back to the proto-germanic compound *skaðin-awjō which appears later in old english as scedenig and in old norse as skáney the earliest identified source for the name scandinavia is pliny the elder's natural history dated to the first century ad
various references to the region can also be found in pytheas pomponius mela tacitus ptolemy procopius and jordanes usually in the form of scandza it is believed that the name used by pliny may be of west germanic origin originally denoting scania according to some scholars the germanic stem can be reconstructed as *skaðan- meaning danger or damage english scathing german schaden dutch schade the second segment of the name has been reconstructed as *awjō meaning land on the water or island the name scandinavia would then mean dangerous island which is considered to refer to the treacherous sandbanks surrounding scania skanör in scania with its long falsterbo reef has the same stem skan combined with -ör which means sandbanks
in the reconstructed germanic root *skaðin-awjō the edh represented in latin by t or d the first segment is sometimes considered more uncertain than the second segment the american heritage dictionary derives the second segment from proto-indo-european *akwa- water in the sense of watery land
the old norse goddess name skaði along with scandinavia and skáney may be related to gothic skadus old english sceadu old saxon scado and old high german scato meaning shadow scholar john mckinnell comments that this etymology suggests that the goddess skaði may have once been a personification of the geographical region of scandinavia or associated with the underworld
pliny's descriptions of scatinavia and surrounding areas are not always easy to decipher writing in the capacity of a roman admiral he introduces the northern region by declaring to his roman readers that there are 23 islands romanis armis cognitae known to roman arms in this area according to pliny the clarissima most famous of the region's islands is scatinavia of unknown size there live the hilleviones the belief that scandinavia was an island became widespread among classical authors during the first century and dominated descriptions of scandinavia in classical texts during the centuries that followed
pliny begins his description of the route to scatinavia by referring to the mountain of saevo mons saevo ibi the codanus bay codanus sinus and the cimbrian promontory the geographical features have been identified in various ways by some scholars saevo is thought to be the mountainous norwegian coast at the entrance to skagerrak and the cimbrian peninsula is thought to be skagen the north tip of jutland denmark as described saevo and scatinavia can also be the same place
pliny mentions scandinavia one more time: in book viii he says that the animal called achlis given in the accusative achlin which is not latin was born on the island of scandinavia the animal grazes has a big upper lip and some mythical attributes
the name scandia later used as a synonym for scandinavia also appears in pliny's naturalis historia but is used for a group of northern european islands which he locates north of britannia scandia thus does not appear to be denoting the island scadinavia in pliny's text the idea that scadinavia may have been one of the scandiae islands was instead introduced by ptolemy c 90 – c 168 ad a mathematician geographer and astrologer of roman egypt he used the name skandia for the biggest most easterly of the three scandiai islands which according to him were all located east of jutland
neither pliny's nor ptolemy's lists of scandinavian tribes include the suiones mentioned by tacitus some early swedish scholars of the swedish hyperborean school and of the 19th-century romantic nationalism period proceeded to synthesize the different versions by inserting references to the suiones arguing that they must have been referred to in the original texts and obscured over time by spelling mistakes or various alterations
the latin names in pliny's text gave rise to different forms in medieval germanic texts in jordanes' history of the goths ad 551 the form scandza is the name used for their original home separated by sea from the land of europe chapter 1 4 where jordanes meant to locate this quasi-legendary island is still a hotly debated issue both in scholarly discussions and in the nationalistic discourse of various european countries the form scadinavia as the original home of the langobards appears in paulus diaconus' historia langobardorum in other versions of historia langobardorum appear the forms scadan scandanan scadanan and scatenauge frankish sources used sconaowe and aethelweard an anglo-saxon historian used scani in beowulf the forms scedenige and scedeland are used while the alfredian translation of orosius and wulfstan's travel accounts used the old english sconeg
the earliest sami yoik texts written down refer to the world as skadesi-suolo north-sami and skađsuâl east-sami meaning skaði's island svennung 1963 svennung considers the sami name to have been introduced as a loan word from the north germanic languages skaði is the giant stepmother of freyr and freyja in norse mythology it has been suggested that skaði to some extent is modeled on a sami woman the name for skade's father thjazi is known in sami as čáhci the waterman and her son with odin saeming can be interpreted as a descendent of saam the sami population mundel 2000 steinsland 1991 older joik texts give evidence of the old sami belief about living on an island and state that the wolf is known as suolu gievra meaning the strong one on the island the sami place name sulliidčielbma means the island's threshold and suoločielgi means the island's back
in recent substrate studies sami linguists have examined the initial cluster sk- in words used in sami and concluded that sk- is a phonotactic structure of alien origin
another possibility is that all or part of the segments of the name came from the mesolithic people inhabiting the region in modernity scandinavia is a peninsula but between approximately 10,300 and 9,500 years ago the southern part of scandinavia was an island separated from the northern peninsula with water exiting the baltic sea through the area where stockholm is now located
some basque scholars have presented the idea that the segment sk that appears in *ska∂inaujàin is connected to the name for the euzko peoples akin to basques that populated paleolithic europe according to some of these intellects scandinavian people share particular genetic markers with the basque people
the geography of scandinavia is extremely varied notable are the norwegian fjords the scandinavian mountains the flat low areas in denmark and the archipelagos of sweden and norway sweden has many lakes and moraines legacies of the ice age
the climate varies from north to south and from west to east a marine west coast climate cfb typical of western europe dominates in denmark southernmost part of sweden and along the west coast of norway reaching north to 65°n with orographic lift giving more mm year precipitation <5000 mm in some areas in western norway the central part – from oslo to stockholm – has a humid continental climate dfb which gradually gives way to subarctic climate dfc further north and cool marine west coast climate cfc along the northwestern coast a small area along the northern coast east of the north cape has tundra climate et as a result of a lack of summer warmth the scandinavian mountains block the mild and moist air coming from the southwest thus northern sweden and the finnmarksvidda plateau in norway receive little precipitation and have cold winters large areas in the scandinavian mountains have alpine tundra climate
the warmest temperature ever recorded in scandinavia is 38.0 °c in målilla sweden the coldest temperature ever recorded is −52.6 °c in vuoggatjålme sweden the coldest month was february 1985 in vittangi sweden with a mean of −27.2 °c
southwesterly winds further warmed by foehn wind can give warm temperatures in narrow norwegian fjords in winter tafjord has recorded 17.9 °c in january and sunndal 18.9 °c in february
two language groups have coexisted on the scandinavian peninsula since prehistory—the north germanic languages scandinavian languages and the sami languages the majority languages on the peninsula swedish and norwegian are today along with danish classified as continental scandinavian
the north germanic languages of scandinavia are traditionally divided into an east scandinavian branch danish and swedish and a west scandinavian branch norwegian icelandic and faroese but because of changes appearing in the languages since 1600 the east scandinavian and west scandinavian branches are now usually reconfigured into insular scandinavian ö-nordisk øy-nordisk featuring icelandic and faroese and continental scandinavian skandinavisk comprising danish norwegian and swedish the modern division is based on the degree of mutual comprehensibility between the languages in the two branches note that skandinaviska may also refer to a way of speaking one scandinavian language in a way intended to be more easily understood by speakers of the other scandinavian languages like the danish saying the beginning of a number in swedish to swedish people
apart from sami and the languages of minority groups speaking a variant of the majority language of a neighboring state the following minority languages in scandinavia are protected under the european charter for regional or minority languages: yiddish romani chib romanes and romani
the dialects of denmark norway and sweden form a dialect continuum and are mutually intelligible the populations of the scandinavian countries with a scandinavian mother tongue can—at least with some training—understand each other's standard languages as they appear in print and are heard on radio and television the reason danish swedish and the two official written versions of norwegian nynorsk and bokmål are traditionally viewed as different languages rather than dialects of one common language is that each is a well established standard language in its respective country they are related to but not mutually intelligible with the other north germanic languages icelandic and faroese which are descended from old west norse danish swedish and norwegian have since medieval times been influenced to varying degrees by middle low german and standard german a substantial amount of that influence was a by-product of the economic activity generated by the hanseatic league
norwegians are accustomed to variation and may perceive danish and swedish only as slightly more distant dialects this is because they have two official written standards in addition to the habit of strongly holding on to local dialects the people of stockholm sweden and copenhagen denmark have the greatest difficulty in understanding other scandinavian languages in the faroe islands and iceland learning danish is mandatory this causes faroese people as well as icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct north germanic languages making it relatively easy for them to understand the other two mainland scandinavian languages
the scandinavian languages are as a language family entirely unrelated to finnish estonian and sami languages which as uralic languages are distantly related to hungarian owing to the close proximity there is still a great deal of borrowing from the swedish and norwegian languages in the finnish estonian and sami languages the long history of linguistic influence of swedish on finnish is also due to the fact that finnish the language of the majority in finland was treated as a minority language while finland was part of sweden finnish-speakers had to learn swedish in order to advance to higher positions swedish spoken in today's finland includes a lot of words that are borrowed from finnish whereas the written language remains closer to that of sweden
although iceland was under the political control of denmark until a much later date 1918 very little influence and borrowing from danish has occurred in the icelandic language icelandic remained the preferred language among the ruling classes in iceland danish was not used for official communications most of the royal officials were of icelandic descent and the language of the church and law courts remained icelandic
the sami languages are indigenous minority languages in scandinavia they belong to their own branch of the uralic language family and are unrelated to the north germanic languages other than by limited grammatical particularly lexical characteristics resulting from prolonged contact sami is divided into several languages or dialects consonant gradation is a feature in both finnish and northern sami dialects but it is not present in south sami which is considered to have a different language history according to the sami information centre of the sami parliament in sweden southern sami may have originated in an earlier migration from the south into the scandinavian peninsula
finland is officially bilingual with finnish and swedish having mostly the same status at national level finland's majority population are finns whose mother tongue is either finnish approximately 95% swedish or both the swedish speaking minority lives mainly on the coast from the city of porvoo in the gulf of finland to the city of kokkola up in the bothnian bay the åland islands an autonomous province of finland situated in the baltic sea between finland and sweden is entirely swedish speaking children are taught the other official language at school for swedish-speakers this is finnish usually from the 3rd grade and for finnish-speakers swedish usually from the 3rd 5th or 7th grade
finnish speakers constitute a language minority in sweden norway and russian federation there are also languages derived from finnish having evolved separately known as meänkieli in sweden and kven in norway
during a period of christianization and state formation in the 10th–13th centuries numerous germanic petty kingdoms and chiefdoms were unified into three kingdoms:
in the 1645 treaty of brömsebro denmark–norway ceded the norwegian provinces of jämtland härjedalen and idre & särna as well as the baltic sea islands of gotland and ösel in estonia to sweden the treaty of roskilde signed in 1658 forced denmark–norway to cede the danish provinces scania blekinge halland bornholm and the norwegian provinces of båhuslen and trøndelag to sweden the 1660 treaty of copenhagen forced sweden to return bornholm and trøndelag to denmark–norway and to give up its recent claims to the island funen
expanding north and east today's finland as well as parts of estonia and russia were under scandinavian rule for significant periods of time scandinavia has despite many wars over the years since the formation of the three kingdoms been politically and culturally close
the three scandinavian kingdoms joined in 1387 in the kalmar union under queen margaret i of denmark sweden left the union in 1523 under king gustav vasa in the aftermath of sweden's secession from the kalmar union civil war broke out in denmark and norway the protestant reformation followed when things had settled the norwegian privy council was abolished—it assembled for the last time in 1537 a personal union entered into by the kingdoms of denmark and norway in 1536 lasted until 1814 three sovereign successor states have subsequently emerged from thi

urban horticulture - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
horticulture is the science and art of growing fruits and vegetables and also flowers or ornamental plants
urban horticulture specifically is the study of the relationship between plants and the urban environment it focuses on the functional use of horticulture so as to maintain and improve the surrounding urban area with the expansion of cities and rapid urbanization urban horticulture is a new term as a result of the urban context this field of study is large and complex and its study has only recently gained momentum it has an undeniable relationship to production horticulture in that fruits vegetables and other plants are grown for harvest aesthetic architectural recreational and psychological purposes but it extends far beyond these benefits the value of plants in the urban environment has yet to be thoroughly researched or quantified


horticulture and the integration of nature into our civilization has been a major part in the establishment of our cities when nomadic civilizations began settling down their major trading centers were the market gardens and farms urban horticulture rapidly progressed with the birth of cities and the increase in experimentation and exchange of ideas these insights led to the field being dispersed to farmers in the hinterlands for centuries the built environment such as homes public buildings etc were integrated with cultivation in the form of gardens farms and grazing lands kitchen gardens farms common grazing land etc therefore horticulture was a regular part of everyday life in the city with the industrial revolution and the related increasing populations rapidly changed the landscape and replaced green spaces with brick and asphalt after the nineteenth century horticulture was then selectively restored in some urban spaces as a response to the unhealthy conditions of factory neighborhoods and cities began seeing the development of parks
early urban horticulture movements majorly served the purposes of short term welfare during recession periods philanthropic charity to uplift the masses or patriotic relief the tradition of urban horticulture mostly declined after world war ii as suburbs became the focus of residential and commercial growth most of the economically stable population moved out of the cities into the suburbs leaving only slums and ghettos at the city centers however there were a few exceptions of garden projects initiated by public housing authorities in the 1950s and 60s for the purpose of beautification and tenant pride but for the most part as businesses also left the metropolitan areas it generated wastelands and areas of segregated poverty
inevitably the disinvestment of major city centers specifically in america resulted in the drastic increase of vacant lots existing buildings became uninhabitable houses were abandoned and even productive industrial land became vacant modern community gardening urban agriculture and food security movements were a form of response to battle the above problems at a local level in fact other movements at that time such as the peace environmental women's civil rights and back-to-the-city movements of the 1960s and 70's and the environmental justice movement of the 1980s and 90's saw opportunity in these vacant lands as a way of reviving communities through school and community gardens farmers' markets and urban agriculture
things have taken a turn in the twenty-first century as people are recognizing the need for local community gardens and green spaces it is not the concept but the purposes that are new the main goals of this movement include cleaning up neighborhoods pushing out drug dealing that occurs at empty lots growing and preserving food for consumption restoring nature to industrial areas and bringing the farming traditions to urban cities essentially community gardening is seen as way of creating a relationship between people and a place through social and physical engagement most urban gardens are created on vacant land that vary in size and are generally gardened as individual plots by community members such areas can support social cultural and artistic events and contribute to the rebuilding of local community spirit the modern community garden movement is initiated by neighborhoods along with the support of the governments and non-profit organizations some gardens are linked to public housing projects schools through garden-based learning programs churches and social agencies and some even employ those who are incarcerated community gardens which are now a large part of the urban horticulture movement are different from the earlier periods of grand park development in that the latter only served to free the people from the industrialism in addition a community garden is more beneficial and engaging than a mere lawn or park and serves as a valuable access to nature where wilderness is unavailable this movement helped create and sustain relationships between city dwellers and the soil and contributed to a different kind of urban environmentalism that did not have any characteristics of reform charity
despite that it has been 30 years since the first community gardens in the states there is no concrete analysis of current urban gardens and their organizations the american community gardening association acga has estimations that show that municipal governments and non-profit organizations operate gardening programs in about 250 cities and towns although the staff of this organization admits that this number could in reality be twice as large in 1994 survey the national gardening association found that 6.7 million households that weren't involved in gardening would be interested in doing so if there was a plot nearby a more recent survey showed that more gardens are being created in cities as opposed to being lost to economic development
today urban horticulture has several components that include more than just community gardens such as market gardens small farms and farmers' markets and is an important aspect of community development another result of urban horticulture is the food security movement where locally grown food is given precedence through several projects and programs thus providing low-cost and nutritious food urban community gardens and the food security movement was a response to the problems of industrial agriculture and to solve its related problems of price inflation lack of supermarkets food scarcity etc
horticulture by itself is a practical and applied science which means it can have a significance in our everyday lives as community gardens cannot actually compete with market-based land uses it is essential to find other ways to understand their various benefits such as their contribution to social human and financial well-being frederick law olmsted the designer of new york city's central park observed that the trees meadows ponds and wildlife tranquilize the stresses of city life according to various studies over the years nature has a very positive impact over human health and even more so in an emotional and psychological sense trees grass and flower gardens due to their presence as well as visibility increase people's life satisfaction by reducing fatigue and irritation and restoring a sense of calm in fact honeyman tested the restorative value of nature scenes in urban settings and discovered that vegetation in an urban setting produced more mental restoration as opposed to areas without vegetation in addition areas with only nature did not have as much of a positive psychological impact as did the combination of urban areas and nature
one of the obvious health benefits of gardening is the increased intake of fruits and vegetables but the act of gardening itself is also a major health benefit gardening is a low-impact exercise which when added into daily activities can help reduce weight lower stress and improve overall health a recent study showed a reduced body mass index and lower weight in community gardeners compared with their non-gardening counterparts the study showed men who gardened had a body mass index -2.36 lower and were 62% less likely to

seawater - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
seawater or salt water is water from a sea or ocean on average seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% 35 g l or 599 mm this means that every kilogram roughly one litre by volume of seawater has approximately 35 grams 1.2 oz of dissolved salts predominantly sodium na+  and chloride cl−  ions average density at the surface is 1.025 kg l seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water density 1.0 kg l at 4 °c 39 °f because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume the freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases at typical salinity it freezes at about −2 °c 28 °f the coldest seawater ever recorded in a liquid state was in 2010 in a stream under an antarctic glacier and measured −2.6 °c 27.3 °f seawater ph is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4 however there is no universally accepted reference ph-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units


the thermal conductivity of seawater is 0.6 w mk at 25 °c and a salinity of 35 g kg the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing salinity and increases with increasing temperature
although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 3.1% and 3.8% seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths or near melting glaciers seawater can be substantially less saline the most saline open sea is the red sea where high rates of evaporation low precipitation and river inflow and confined circulation result in unusually salty water the salinity in isolated bodies of water for example the dead sea can be considerably greater still
the density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kg m depending on the temperature and salinity deep in the ocean under high pressure seawater can reach a density of 1050 kg m or higher seawater ph is limited to the range 7.5 and 8.4 the speed of sound in seawater is about 1,500 m s and varies with water temperature salinity and pressure
seawater contains more dissolved ions than all types of freshwater however the ratios of solutes differ dramatically for instance although seawater contains about 2.8 times more bicarbonate than river water based on molarity the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water bicarbonate ions also constitute 48% of river water solutes but only 0.14% of all seawater ions differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes sodium and chlorine have very long residence times while calcium vital for carbonate formation tends to precipitate much more quickly the most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium chloride magnesium sulfate and calcium its osmolarity is about 1000 mosm l
small amounts of other substances are found including amino acids at concentrations up to 2 micrograms of nitrogen atoms per liter which are thought to have played a key role in the origin of life
research in 1957 by the scripps institution of oceanography sampled water in both pelagic and neritic locations in the pacific ocean direct microscopic counts and cultures were used the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures these differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates selective effects of the culture media and the presence of inactive cells a marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the thermocline but not by direct microscopic observation large numbers of spirilli-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation the disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields in the 1990s improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of dna enabled researchers taking part in the census of marine life to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers this revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20 000 species dr mitchell sogin from the marine biological laboratory feels that the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million
bacteria are found at all depths in the water column as well as in the sediments some being aerobic others anaerobic most are free-swimming but some exist as symbionts within other organisms – examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria cyanobacteria played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes enabling the development of stromatolites and oxygen in the atmosphere
some bacteria interact with diatoms and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean one anaerobic species thiomargarita namibiensis plays an important part in the breakdown of hydrogen sulphide eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the namibian coast and generated by high rates of phytoplankton growth in the benguela current upwelling zone eventually falling to the seafloor
bacteria-like archaea surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments such as the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as pseudomonas and vibrio spp survive in a ph range of 7.3 to 10.6 while some species will grow only at ph 10 to 10.6 archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean's biomass clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes in 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of archaea that breaks down methane an important greenhouse gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor influencing seawater chemistry oil spills and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life the protist dinoflagellates may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or red tides often after human-caused pollution the process may produce metabolites known as biotoxins which move along the ocean food chain tainting higher-order animal consumers
pandoravirus salinus a species of very large virus with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species was discovered in 2013 like the other very large viruses mimivirus and megavirus pandoravirus infects amoebas but its genome containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of dna is twice as large as that of megavirus and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure
in 2013 researchers from aberdeen university announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that has evolved in deep sea trenches hoping to find the next generation of antibiotics anticipating an antibiotic apocalypse with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs the eu-funded research will start in the atacama trench and then move on to search trenches off new zealand and antarctica
the ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material while this may be true on a small scale the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems and rendered them life-threatening pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters such as escherichia coli vibrio cholerae the cause of cholera hepatitis a hepatitis e and polio along with protozoans causing giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis these pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged
scientific theories behind the origins of sea salt started with sir edmond halley in 1715 who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground upon reaching the ocean these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time see hydrologic cycle halley noted that most lakes that don’t have oce

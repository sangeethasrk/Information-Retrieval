in 1993 christie's paid $10.9 million for the london gallery spink & sons which specialised in oriental art and british paintings the gallery was run as a separate entity from the auction house the company bought leger gallery for $3.3 million in 1996 and merged it with spink to become spink-leger spink-leger was closed in 2002 to make itself competitive with sotheby's in real estate christie's bought great estates in 1995 then the largest network of independent real estate brokers in north america changing its name to christie's great estates inc
in december 1997 under the chairmanship of lord hindlip christie's put itself on the auction block but after two months of negotiations with the consortium-led investment firm sbc warburg dillon read it did not attract a bid high enough to accept in may 1998 françois pinault's holding company groupe artémis sa first bought 29.1 percent of the company for $243.2 million and subsequently purchased the rest of it in a deal that valued the entire company at $1.2 billion the company has since not been reporting profits though it gives sale totals twice a year its policy in line with uk accounting standards is to convert non-uk results using an average exchange rate weighted daily by sales throughout the year in 2002 christie's france held its first auction in paris

jet fuel - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
jet fuel aviation turbine fuel atf or avtur is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines it is colourless to straw-colored in appearance the most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are jet a and jet a-1 which are produced to a standardized international specification the only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is jet b which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance
jet fuel is a mixture of a large number of different hydrocarbons the range of their sizes molecular weights or carbon numbers is restricted by the requirements for the product for example the freezing point or smoke point kerosene-type jet fuel including jet a and jet a-1 has a carbon number distribution between about 8 and 16 carbon atoms per molecule wide-cut or naphtha-type jet fuel including jet b between about 5 and 15


fuel for piston-engine powered aircraft usually a high-octane gasoline known as avgas has a low flash point to improve its ignition characteristics turbine engines can operate with a wide range of fuels and jet-aircraft engines typically use fuels with higher flash points which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle
the first axial compressor jet engine in widespread production and combat service the junkers jumo 004 on the messerschmitt me 262a fighter and the arado ar 234b jet recon-bomber burned either a special synthetic j2 fuel or diesel fuel gasoline was a third option but unattractive due to high fuel consumption other fuels used were kerosene or kerosene and gasoline mixtures most jet fuels in use since the end of world war ii are kerosene-based both british and american standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of world war ii british standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lamps—known as paraffin in the uk—whereas american standards derived from aviation gasoline practices over the subsequent years details of specifications were adjusted such as minimum freezing point to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels very low temperature freezing points reduce the availability of fuel higher flash point products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce in the united states astm international produces standards for civilian fuel types and the us department of defense produces standards for military use the british ministry of defence establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels for reasons of inter-operational ability british and united states military standards are harmonized to a degree in russia and former soviet union countries grades of jet fuels are covered by the state standard gost number or a technical condition number with the principal grade available in russia and members of the cis being ts-1
jet a specification fuel has been used in the united states since the 1950s and is usually not available outside the united states and a few canadian airports such as toronto and vancouver whereas jet a-1 is the standard specification fuel used in the rest of the world other than the former soviet states where ts-1 is the most common standard both jet a and jet a-1 have a flash point higher than 38 °c 100 °f with an autoignition temperature of 210 °c 410 °f
the primary difference is the lower freezing point of a-1:
the other difference is the mandatory addition of an anti-static additive to jet a-1
as with jet a-1 jet a can be identified in trucks and storage facilities by the un number 1863 hazardous material placards jet a trucks storage tanks and plumbing that carry jet a are marked with a black sticker with jet a in white printed on it adjacent to another black stripe
jet a-1 fuel must meet:
jet a fuel must reach astm specification d1655 jet a
typical physical properties for jet a   jet a-1
jet b is a fuel in the naphtha-kerosene region that is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance however jet b's lighter composition makes it more dangerous to handle for this reason it is rarely used except in very cold climates a blend of approximately 30% kerosene and 70% gasoline it is known as wide-cut fuel it has a very low freezing point of −60 °c −76 °f and a low flash point as well it is primarily used in some military aircraft it is also used in canada alaska and sometimes russia because of its freezing point
the def stan 91-91 uk and astm d1655 international specifications allow for certain additives to be added to jet fuel including:
as the aviation industry’s jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5% of all refined products derived from crude it has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosine a high value product by varying process techniques new processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the manufacture of synthetic blend stocks due to the number and severity of the processes used it is often necessary and sometimes mandatory to use additives these additives may for example prevent the formation of harmful chemical species or improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear
it is very important that jet fuel be free from water contamination during flight the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere this causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel the separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank because it is denser than the fuel since the water is no longer in solution it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 °c if these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes this was the cause of the british airways flight 38 accident removing all water from fuel is impractical therefore fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing
there are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel a visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance an industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30 ppm parts per million free watera critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is astm standard d3948 standard test method for determining water separation characteristics of aviation turbine fuels by portable separometer
military organizations around the world use a different classification system of jp for jet propellant numbers some are almost identical to their civilian counterparts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives jet a-1 is similar to jp-8 jet b is similar to jp-4 other military fuels are highly specialized products and are developed for very specific applications
jet fuels are sometimes classified as kerosene or naphtha-type kerosene-type fuels include jet a jet a-1 jp-5 and jp-8 naphtha-type jet fuels sometimes referred to as wide-cut jet fuel include jet b and jp-4
the jp-4 and jp-5 fuels covered by the mil-dtl-5624 and meeting the british specification def stan 91-86 avcat fsii formerly derd 2452 are intended for use in aircraft turbine engines these fuels require military-unique additives that are necessary in military weapon systems engines and missions
jet fuel is very similar to diesel fuel and in some cases may be burned in diesel engines the possibility of environmental legislation banning the use of leaded avgas and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance has left aircraft designers and pilot's organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft as a result a few aircraft engine manufacturers most notably thielert and austro engine have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on jet fuel this technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required jet fuel is available in most places in the world whereas avgas is only wide

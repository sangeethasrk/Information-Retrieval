thorium fuel cycle - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the thorium fuel cycle is a nuclear fuel cycle that uses the isotope of thorium 232th as the fertile material in the reactor 232th is transmuted into the fissile artificial uranium isotope 233u which is the nuclear fuel unlike natural uranium natural thorium contains only trace amounts of fissile material such as 231th which are insufficient to initiate a nuclear chain reaction additional fissile material or another neutron source are necessary to initiate the fuel cycle in a thorium-fueled reactor 232th absorbs neutrons eventually to produce 233u this parallels the process in uranium breeder reactors whereby fertile 238u absorbs neutrons to form fissile 239pu depending on the design of the reactor and fuel cycle the generated 233u either fissions in situ or is chemically separated from the used nuclear fuel and formed into new nuclear fuel
the thorium fuel cycle claims several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle including thorium's greater abundance superior physical and nuclear properties better resistance to nuclear weapons proliferation and reduced plutonium and actinide production


concerns about the limits of worldwide uranium resources motivated initial interest in the thorium fuel cycle it was envisioned that as uranium reserves were depleted thorium would supplement uranium as a fertile material however for most countries uranium was relatively abundant and research in thorium fuel cycles waned a notable exception was india's three-stage nuclear power programme in the twenty-first century thorium's potential for improving proliferation resistance and waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle
at oak ridge national laboratory in the 1960s the molten-salt reactor experiment used 233u as the fissile fuel as an experiment to demonstrate a part of the molten salt breeder reactor that was designed to operate on the thorium fuel cycle molten salt reactor msr experiments assessed thorium's feasibility using thoriumiv fluoride dissolved in a molten salt fluid that eliminated the need to fabricate fuel elements the msr program was defunded in 1976 after its patron alvin weinberg was fired
in 2006 carlo rubbia proposed the concept of an energy amplifier or accelerator driven system ads which he saw as a novel and safe way to produce nuclear energy that exploited existing accelerator technologies rubbia's proposal offered the potential to incinerate high-activity nuclear waste and produce energy from natural thorium and depleted uranium
kirk sorensen former nasa scientist and chief nuclear technologist at teledyne brown engineering has been a long-time promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors lftrs he first researched thorium reactors while working at nasa while evaluating power plant designs suitable for lunar colonies in 2006 sorensen started energyfromthoriumcom to promote and make information available about this technology
a 2011 mit study concluded that although there is little in the way of barriers to a thorium fuel cycle with current or near term light-water reactor designs there is also little incentive for any significant market penetration to occur as such they conclude there is little chance of thorium cycles replacing conventional uranium cycles in the current nuclear power market despite the potential benefits
thorium is like wet wood …it needs to be turned into fissile uranium just as wet wood needs to be dried in a furnace
in the thorium cycle fuel is formed when 232th captures a neutron whether in a fast reactor or thermal reactor to become 233th this normally emits an electron and an anti-neutrino ν by β− decay to become 233pa this then emits another electron and anti-neutrino by a second β− decay to become 233u the fuel:
nuclear fission produces radioactive fission products which can have half-lives from days to greater than 200,000 years according to some toxicity studies the thorium cycle can fully recycle actinide wastes and only emit fission product wastes and after a few hundred years the waste from a thorium reactor can be less toxic than the uranium ore that would have been used to produce low enriched uranium fuel for a light water reactor of the same power other studies assume some actinide losses and find that actinide wastes dominate thorium cycle waste radioactivity at some future periods
in a reactor when a neutron hits a fissile atom such as certain isotopes of uranium it either splits the nucleus or is captured and transmutes the atom in the case of 233u the transmutations tend to produce useful nuclear fuels rather than transuranic wastes when 233u absorbs a neutron it either fissions or becomes 234u the chance of fissioning on absorption of a thermal neutron is about 92% the capture-to-fission ratio of 233u therefore is about 1:12 — which is better than the corresponding capture vs fission ratios of 235u about 1:6 or 239pu or 241pu both about 1:3 the result is less transuranic waste than in a reactor using the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle
234u like most actinides with an even number of neutrons is not fissile but neutron capture produces fissile 235u if the fissile isotope fails to fission on neutron capture it produces 236u 237np 238pu and eventually fissile 239pu and heavier isotopes of plutonium the 237np can be removed and stored as waste or retained and transmuted to plutonium where more of it fissions while the remainder becomes 242pu then americium and curium which in turn can be removed as waste or returned to reactors for further transmutation and fission
however the 231pa with a half-life of 7012103193352000000♠3.27×10 years formed via n2n reactions with 232th yielding 231th that decays to 231pa while not a transuranic waste is a major contributor to the long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel
uranium-232 is also formed in this process via n2n reactions between fast neutrons and 233u 233pa and 232th:
uranium-232 has a relatively short half-life 7009217431864000000♠68.9 years and some decay products emit high energy gamma radiation such as 224rn 212bi and particularly 208tl the full decay chain along with half-lives and relevant gamma energies is:
232u decays to 228th where it joins the decay chain of 232th
thorium-cycle fuels produce hard gamma emissions which damage electronics limiting their use in military bomb triggers 232u cannot be chemically separated from 233u from used nuclear fuel however chemical separation of thorium from uranium removes the decay product 228th and the radiation from the rest of the decay chain which gradually build up as 228th reaccumulates the hard gamma emissions also create a radiological hazard which requires remote handling during reprocessing
as a fertile material thorium is similar to 238u the major part of natural and depleted uranium the thermal neutron absorption cross section σa and resonance integral average of neutron cross sections over intermediate neutron energies for 232th are about three times and one third of the respective values for 238u
thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in earth's crust although present knowledge of reserves is limited current demand for thorium has been satisfied as a by-product of rare-earth extraction from monazite sands
although the thermal neutron fission cross section σf of the resulting 233u is comparable to 235u and 239pu it has a much lower capture cross section σγ than the latter two fissile isotopes providing fewer non-fissile neutron absorptions and improved neutron economy finally the ratio of neutrons released per neutron absorbed η in 233u is greater than two over a wide range of energies including the thermal spectrum as a result thorium-based fuels can be the basis for a thermal breeder reactor a breeding reactor in the uranium - plutonium cycle needs to use a fast neutron spectrum because in the thermal spectrum one neutron absorbed by 239pu on average leads to less than two neutrons
thorium-based fuels also display favorable physical and chemical properties that improve reactor and repository performance compared to the pred

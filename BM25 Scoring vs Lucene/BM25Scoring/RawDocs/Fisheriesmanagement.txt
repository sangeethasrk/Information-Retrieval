fisheries management - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
fisheries management draws on fisheries science in order to find ways to protect fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of appropriate management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules which are put in place by a system of monitoring control and surveillance according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao there are no clear and generally accepted definitions of fisheries management however the working definition used by the fao and much cited elsewhere is:
the integrated process of information gathering analysis planning consultation decision-making allocation of resources and formulation and implementation with enforcement as necessary of regulations or rules which govern fisheries activities in order to ensure the continued productivity of the resources and the accomplishment of other fisheries objectives


fisheries have been explicitly managed in some places for hundreds of years more than 80 percent of the worlds commercial exploitation of fish and shellfish are harvest from natural occurring populations in the oceans and freshwater areas for example the māori people new zealand residents for about 700 years had prohibitions against taking more than could be eaten and about giving back the first fish caught as an offering to sea god tangaroa starting in the 18th century attempts were made to regulate fishing in the north norwegian fishery this resulted in the enactment of a law in 1816 on the lofoten fishery which established in some measure what has come to be known as territorial use rights
the fishing banks were divided into areas belonging to the nearest fishing base on land and further subdivided into fields where the boats were allowed to fish the allocation of the fishing fields was in the hands of local governing committees usually headed by the owner of the onshore facilities which the fishermen had to rent for accommodation and for drying the fish
governmental resource protection-based fisheries management is a relatively new idea first developed for north european fisheries after the first overfishing conference held in london in 1936 in 1957 british fisheries researchers ray beverton and sidney holt published a seminal work on north sea commercial fisheries dynamics in the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for north european management schemes
after some years away from the field of fisheries management beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first world fisheries congress in athens in 1992 the dynamics of exploited fish populations expressed his concerns including the way his and sidney holt's work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years nevertheless the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid
a report by prince charles' international sustainability unit the new york-based environmental defense fund and 50in10 published in july 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global gdp but by full implementation of sustainable fishing that figure could rise by an extra amount of as much as $50 billion
according to the fao fisheries management should be based explicitly on political objectives ideally with transparent priorities typical political objectives when exploiting a fish resource are to:
such political goals can also be a weak part of fisheries management since the objectives can conflict with each other
fisheries objectives need to be expressed in concrete management rules in most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed though non-binding code of conduct for responsible fisheries agreed at a meeting of the un's food and agriculture organization fao session in 1995 the precautionary approach it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum spawning biomass maximum fishing mortality rates etc in 2005 the ubc fisheries centre at the university of british columbia comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world's major fishing nations against the code
international agreements are required in order to regulate fisheries in international waters the desire for agreement on this and other maritime issues led to three conferences on the law of the sea and ultimately to the treaty known as the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos concepts such as exclusive economic zones eez extending 200 nautical miles 370 km from a nation's coasts allocate certain sovereign rights and responsibilities for resource management to individual countries
other situations need additional intergovernmental coordination for example in the mediterranean sea and other relatively narrow bodies of water eez of 200 nautical miles 370 km are irrelevant international waters beyond 12-nautical-mile 22 km from shore require explicit agreements
straddling fish stocks which migrate through more than one eez also present challenges here sovereign responsibility must be agreed with neighbouring coastal states and fishing entities usually this is done through the medium of a regional organisation set up for the purpose of coordinating the management of that stock
unclos does not prescribe precisely how fisheries confined only to international waters should be managed several new fisheries such as high seas bottom trawling fisheries are not yet subject to international agreement across their entire range in november 2004 the un general assembly issued a resolution on fisheries that prepared for further development of international fisheries management law
many countries have set up ministries government departments named ministry of fisheries or similar controlling aspects of fisheries within their exclusive economic zones four categories of management means have been devised regulating either input investment or output and operating either directly or indirectly:
technical means may include:
systems that use individual transferable quotas itq also called individual fishing quota limit the total catch and allocate shares of that quota among the fishers who work that fishery fishers can buy sell trade shares as they choose
a large scale study in 2008 provided strong evidence that itq's can help to prevent fishery collapse and even restore fisheries that appear to be in decline other studies have shown negative socio-economic consequences of itqs especially on small-sclale fisheries these consequences include concentration of quota in that hands of few fishers increased number of inactive fishers leasing their quotas to others a phenomenon known as armchair fishermen and detrimental effects on coastal communities
the fishery manager's guidebook issued in 2009 by the fao of the united nations advises that the precautionary approach or principle should be applied when ecosystem resilience and human impact including reversibility are difficult to forecast and hard to distinguish from natural changes the precautionary principle suggests that when an action risks harm it should not be proceeded with until it can be scientifically proven to be safe historically fishery managers have applied this principle the other way round fishing activities have not been curtailed until it has been proven that they have already damaged existing ecosystems in a paper published in 2007 shertzer and prager suggested that there can be significant benefits to stock biomass and fishery yield if management is stricter and more prompt
fisheries law is an emerging and specialized area of law which includes the study and analysis of different fisheries management approaches including seafood safety regulations and aquaculture regulations despite its importance this area is rarely taught at law schools around the world which leaves a vacuum of advocacy and research
in the past changing climate has affected inland and offshore fisheries and such changes are likely to continue from a fisheries perspective the specific driving factors of

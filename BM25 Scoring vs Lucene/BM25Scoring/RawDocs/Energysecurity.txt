energy security - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
energy security is the association between national security and the availability of natural resources for energy consumption access to cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies however the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities
renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency and technological diversification of energy sources would result in significant energy security and economic benefits


the modern world relies on a vast energy supply to fuel everything from transportation to communication to security and health delivery systems perhaps most alarmingly peak oil expert michael ruppert has claimed that for every calorie of food produced in the industrial world ten calories of oil and gas energy are invested in the forms of fertilizer pesticide packaging transportation and running farm equipment energy plays an important role in the national security of any given country as a fuel to power the economic engine some sectors rely on energy more heavily than others for example the department of defense relies on petroleum for approximately 77% of its energy needs threats to energy security include the political instability of several energy producing countries the manipulation of energy supplies the competition over energy sources attacks on supply infrastructure as well as accidents natural disasters terrorism and reliance on foreign countries for oil
foreign oil supplies are vulnerable to unnatural disruptions from in-state conflict exporters’ interests and non-state actors targeting the supply and transportation of oil resources the political and economic instability caused by war or other factors such as strike action can also prevent the proper functioning of the energy industry in a supplier country for example the nationalization of oil in venezuela has triggered strikes and protests in which venezuela’s oil production rates have yet to recover exporters may have political or economic incentive to limit their foreign sales or cause disruptions in the supply chain since venezuela’s nationalization of oil anti-american hugo chávez threatened to cut off supplies to the united states more than once the 1973 oil embargo against the united states is a historical example in which oil supplies were cut off to the united states due to us support of israel during the yom kippur war this has been done to apply pressure during economic negotiations—such as during the 2007 russia–belarus energy dispute terrorist attacks targeting oil facilities pipelines tankers refineries and oil fields are so common they are referred to as “industry risks” infrastructure for producing the resource is extremely vulnerable to sabotage one of the worst risks to oil transportation is the exposure of the five ocean chokepoints like the iranian-controlled strait of hormuz anthony cordesman a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington dc warns “it may take only one asymmetric or conventional attack on a ghawar saudi oil field or tankers in the strait of hormuz to throw the market into a spiral
new threats to energy security have emerged in the form of the increased world competition for energy resources due to the increased pace of industrialization in countries such as india and china as well as due to the increasing consequences of climate change although still a minority concern the possibility of price rises resulting from the peaking of world oil production is also starting to attract the attention of at least the french government increased competition over energy resources may also lead to the formation of security compacts to enable an equitable distribution of oil and gas between major powers however this may happen at the expense of less developed economies the group of five precursors to the g8 first met in 1975 to coordinate economic and energy policies in the wake of the 1973 arab oil embargo a rise in inflation and a global economic slowdown nato leaders meeting in bucharest romania in april 2008 may discuss the possibility of using the military alliance as an instrument of energy security one of the possibilities include placing troops in the caucasus region to police oil and gas pipelines
long-term measures to increase energy security center on reducing dependence on any one source of imported energy increasing the number of suppliers exploiting native fossil fuel or renewable energy resources and reducing overall demand through energy conservation measures it can also involve entering into international agreements to underpin international energy trading relationships such as the energy charter treaty in europe all the concern coming from security threats on oil sources long term security measures will help reduce the future cost of importing and exporting fuel into and out of countries without having to worry about harm coming to the goods being transported
the impact of the 1973 oil crisis and the emergence of the opec cartel was a particular milestone that prompted some countries to increase their energy security japan almost totally dependent on imported oil steadily introduced the use of natural gas nuclear power high-speed mass transit systems and implemented energy conservation measures the united kingdom began exploiting north sea oil and gas reserves and became a net exporter of energy into the 2000s
in other countries energy security has historically been a lower priority the united states for example has continued to increase its dependency on imported oil although following the oil price increases since 2003 the development of biofuels has been suggested as a means of addressing this
increasing energy security is also one of the reasons behind a block on the development of natural gas imports in sweden greater investment in native renewable energy technologies and energy conservation is envisaged instead india is carrying out a major hunt for domestic oil to decrease its dependency on opec while iceland is well advanced in its plans to become energy independent by 2050 through deploying 100% renewable energy
petroleum otherwise known as crude oil has become the resource most used by countries all around the world including russia china actually china is mostly dependent on coal 70.5% in 2010 and the united states of america with all the oil wells located around the world energy security has become a main issue to ensure the safety of the petroleum that is being harvested in the middle east oil fields become main targets for sabotage because of how heavily countries rely on oil many countries hold strategic petroleum reserves as a buffer against the economic and political impacts of an energy crisis all 28 members of the international energy agency hold a minimum of 90 days of their oil imports for example
the value of such reserves was demonstrated by the relative lack of disruption caused by the 2007 russia-belarus energy dispute when russia indirectly cut exports to several countries in the european union
due to the theories in peak oil and need to curb demand the united states military and department of defense had made significant cuts and have been making a number of attempts to come up with more efficient ways to use oil
compared to petroleum reliance on imported natural gas creates significant short-term vulnerabilities many european countries saw an immediate drop in supply when russian gas supplies were halted during the russia-ukraine gas dispute in 2006
natural gas has been a viable source of energy in the world consisting of mostly methane natural gas is produced using two methods: biogenic and thermogenic biogenic gas comes from methanogenic organisms located in marshes and landfills whereas thermogenic gas comes from the anaerobic decay of organic matter deep under the earth's surface russia is the current leading country in production of natur

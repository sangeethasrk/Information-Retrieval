energy transition - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
energy transition means a long-term structural change in energy systems these have occurred in the past and still occur worldwide historic energy transitions are most broadly described by vaclav smil contemporary energy transitions differ in terms of motivation and objectives drivers and governance in a more narrow sense a sustainable energy transition is the shift by some countries most notably germany german: energiewende to decentralised renewable energy and energy efficiency although so far these shifts have been replacing nuclear energy their declared goal is also the abolishment of coal and other non-renewable energy sources and the creation of an energy system based on 100% renewable energy
renewable energy encompasses wind biomass such as landfill gas and sewage gas hydropower solar power thermal and photovoltaic geothermal and ocean power these renewable sources are to serve as an alternative to fossil fuels oil coal natural gas and nuclear fuel uranium solving the energy problem is regarded as the most important challenge humankind has to face in the 21st century
piecemeal measures often have only limited potential so a timely implementation for the energy transition requires multiple approaches in parallel energy conservation and improvements in energy efficiency thus play a major role an example of an effective energy conservation measure is improved insulation for buildings an example of improved energy efficiency is cogeneration of heat and power smart electric meters can schedule energy consumption for times when electricity is available inexpensively
after such a transitional period with a continuing increase in renewable energy production these are expected to make up most if not all of the world's energy production in 50 years according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency dramatically reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases


the term 'energy transition' designates a significant change in energy policy: the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation for example producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency
in a broader sense the energy transition also entails a democratization of energy: in the traditional energy industry a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power renewable energies in contrast can as a rule be established in a decentralized manner public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders also significant the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy and local governments often promote them there is lots of room for growth with wind solar geothermal and biomass for power they represented 2% of global final energy consumption in 2012
austria embarked on its energy transition energiewende some decades ago due to geographical conditions energy production in austria relies heavily on renewable energies notably hydropower 78.4% of domestic production in 2013 came from renewable energy 9.2% from natural gas and 7.2% from petroleum rest: waste on the basis of the federal constitutional law for a nuclear-free austria no nuclear power plants are in operation in austria
but domestic energy production makes up only 36% of austria's total energy consumption which among other things encompasses transport electricity production and heating in 2013 oil accounts for about 36.2% of total energy consumption renewable energies 29.8% gas 20.6% and coal 9.7% in the past 20 years the structure of gross domestic energy consumption has shifted from coal and oil to new renewables in particular between 2005 to 2013 plus 60% the eu target for austria require a renewables share of 34% by 2020 gross final energy consumption austria is on a good way to achieve this target 32.5% in 2013 energy transition in austria can be also seen on the local level in some villages towns and regions for example the town of güssing in the state of burgenland is a pioneer in independent and sustainable energy production since 2005 güssing has already produced significantly more heating 58 gigawatt hours and electricity 14 gwh from renewable resources than the city itself needs
the united kingdom is mainly focusing on wind power both onshore and offshore and in particular is strongly promoting the establishment of offshore wind power with an installed capacity of 2.1 gw about half of the world's installed offshore wind power britain is the worldwide leader at the end of 2012 the country had an 8.4 gw of overall installed wind power capacity putting it in fourth place worldwide after china the united states and germany it was initially promoted with a quota system but expansion targets were missed repeatedly this led the government to implement a feed-in tariff instead
denmark as a country reliant on imported oil was impacted particularly hard by the 1973 oil crisis this roused public discussions on building nuclear power plants to diversify energy supply a strong anti-nuclear movement developed which fiercely criticized nuclear power plans taken up by the government and this ultimately led to a 1985 resolution not to build any nuclear power plants in denmark the country instead opted for renewable energy focusing primarily on wind power wind turbines for power generation already had a long history in denmark as far back as the late 1800s as early as 1974 a panel of experts declared that it should be possible to satisfy 10% of danish electricity demand with wind power without causing special technical problems for the public grid denmark undertook the development of large wind power stations — though at first with little success like with the growian project in germany
small facilities prevailed instead often sold to private owners such as farms government policies promoted their construction at the same time positive geographical factors favored their spread such as good wind power density and denmark's decentralized patterns of settlement a lack of administrative obstacles also played a role small and robust systems came on line at first in the power range of only 50-60 kilowatts — using 1940s technology and sometimes hand-crafted by very small businesses in the late seventies and the eighties a brisk export trade to the united states developed where wind energy also experienced an early boom in 1986 denmark already had about 1200 wind power turbines though they still accounted for just barely 1% of denmark's electricity this share increased significantly over time in 2011 renewable energies covered 41% of electricity consumption and wind power facilities alone accounted for 28% the government aims to increase wind energy's share of power generation to 50% by 2020 while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40% on 22 march 2012 the danish ministry of climate energy and building published a four-page paper titled dk energy agreement outlining long-term principles for danish energy policy
the installation of oil and gas heating is banned in newly constructed buildings from the start of 2013 beginning in 2016 this will also apply to existing buildings at the same time an assistance program for heater replacement was launched denmark's goal is to reduce the use of fossil fuels 33% by 2020 the country is scheduled to attain complete independence from petroleum and natural gas by 2050
since 2012 political discussions have been developing in france about the energy transition and how the french economy might profit from it

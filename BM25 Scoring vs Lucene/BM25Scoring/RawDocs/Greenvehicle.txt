green vehicle - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
a green vehicle is a road motor vehicle that produces less harmful impacts to the environment than comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicles running on gasoline or diesel or one that uses certain alternative fuels presently in some countries the term is used for any vehicle complying or surpassing the more stringent european emission standards such as euro6 or california's zero emissions vehicle standards such as zev ulev sulev pzev or the low-carbon fuel standards enacted in several countries
green vehicles can be powered by alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles plug-in hybrid electric vehicles battery electric vehicles compressed-air vehicles hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles neat ethanol vehicles flexible-fuel vehicles natural gas vehicles clean diesel vehicles and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or gasohol several author also include conventional motor vehicles with high fuel economy as they consider that increasing fuel economy is the most cost-effective way to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector in the short run as part of their contribution to sustainable transport these vehicles reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to energy independence by reducing oil imports
an environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions a life-cycle assessment involves production and post-use considerations a cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency


cars with similar production of energy costs can obtain during the life of the car operational phase large reductions in energy costs through several measures:
green vehicles include vehicles types that function fully or partly on alternative energy sources other than fossil fuel or less carbon intensive than gasoline or diesel
another option is the use of alternative fuel composition in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles making them function partially on renewable energy sources other approaches include personal rapid transit a public transportation concept that offers automated on-demand non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways
examples of vehicles with reduced petroleum consumption include electric cars plug-in hybrids and fuel cell-powered hydrogen cars
electric cars are typically more efficient than fuel cell-powered vehicles on a tank-to-wheel basis for this reason battery powered vehicles and plug-in hybrids are gaining popularity they have better fuel economy than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles but are hampered by range or maximum distance attainable before discharging the battery the electric car batteries are their main cost they provide a 0% to 99.9% reduction in co2 emissions compared to an ice gasoline diesel vehicle depending on the source of electricity
hybrid cars may be partly fossil fuel or biofuel powered and partly electric or hydrogen-powered most combine an internal combustion engine with an electric engine though other variations too exist the internal combustion engine is often either a gasoline or diesel engine in rare cases a stirling engine may even be used they are more expensive to purchase but cost redemption is achieved in a period of about 5 years due to better fuel economy
compressed air cars stirling-powered vehicles liquid nitrogen vehicles are even less polluting than electrical vehicles as the vehicle and its components can be made more environmentally friendly
solar car races are held on a regular basis in order to promote green vehicles and other green technology these sleek driver-only vehicles can travel long distances at highway speeds using only the electricity generated instantaneously from the sun
a conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle by mixing in renewable fuels or using less carbon intensive fossil fuel typical gasoline-powered cars can tolerate up to 10% ethanol brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol though there were discontinued another available option is a flexible-fuel vehicle which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to 85% in north america and europe and up to 100% in brazil another existing option is to convert a conventional gasoline-powered to allow the alternative use of cng pakistan argentina brazil iran india italy and china have the largest fleets of natural gas vehicles in the world
diesel-powered vehicles can often transition completely to biodiesel though the fuel is a very strong solvent which can occasionally damage rubber seals in vehicles built before 1994 more commonly however biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine clogging filters unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel it is very effective at 'de-coking' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some north american national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days biodiesel and vegetable oil fuelled diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the us tour de sol competition
this presents problems as biofuels can use food resources in order to provide mechanical energy for vehicles many experts point to this as a reason for growing food prices particularly us bio-ethanol fuel production which has affected maize prices in order to have a low environmental impact biofuels should be made only from waste products or from new sources like algae
multiple companies are offering and developing two three and four wheel vehicles combining the characteristics of a bicycle with electric motors us federal state and local laws do not clearly nor consistently classify these vehicles as bicycles electric bicycles motorcycles electric motorcycles mopeds neighborhood electric vehicle motorised quadricycle or as a car some laws have limits on top speeds power of the motors range etc while others do not
horse and carriage are just one type of animal propelled vehicle once a common form of transportation they became far less common as cities grew and automobiles took their place in dense cities the waste produced by large numbers of transportation animals was a significant health problem oftentimes the food is produced for them using diesel powered tractors and thus there is some environmental impact as a result of their use
human powered transport includes walking bicycles velomobiles row boats and other environmentally friendly ways of getting around in addition to the health benefits of the exercise provided they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options the only downside is the speed limitations and how far one can travel before getting exhausted
vehicle emissions contribute to the increasing concentration of gases linked to climate change in order of significance the principal greenhouse gases associated with road transport are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o road transport is the third largest source of greenhouse gases emitted in the uk and accounts for over 20% of total emissions and 33% in the united states of the total greenhouse gas emissions from transport over 85% are due to co2 emissions from road vehicles the transport sector is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases
vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer a 1998 report estimated that up to 24,000 people die prematurely each year in the uk as a direct result of air pollution according to the world health organisation up to 13,000 deaths per year among children aged 0â€“4 years across europe are directly attributable to outdoor pollution the organization estimates that if pollution levels were returned to within eu limits more than 5,000 of these lives could be save

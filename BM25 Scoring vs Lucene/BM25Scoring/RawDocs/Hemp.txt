hemp - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
hemp from old english hænep is a commonly used term for high-growing industrial varieties of the cannabis plant and its products which include fiber oil and seed hemp is refined into products such as hemp seed foods hemp oil wax resin rope cloth pulp paper and fuel
hemp is not to be confused with the close relative marijuana which is also a cannabis plant but is widely used as a recreational drug and medicine these variants are typically low-growing and have higher content of tetrahydrocannabinol thc cannabidiol cbd and other cannabinoids the legality of cannabis varies widely from country to country and from state to state in the united states in many countries regulatory limits for concentrations of psychoactive compounds particularly thc in hemp require the use of strains of the plant which are bred for low content


hemp is used for many varieties of products including the manufacture of cordage of varying tensile strength durable clothing and nutritional products the bast fibers can be used in 100% hemp products but are commonly blended with other organic fibers such as flax cotton or silk for apparel and furnishings most commonly at a 55% 45% hemp cotton blend the inner two fibers of hemp are more woody and are more often used in non-woven items and other industrial applications such as mulch animal bedding and litter the oil from the fruits seeds oxidizes commonly though inaccurately called drying to become solid on exposure to air similar to linseed oil and is sometimes used in the manufacture of oil-based paints in creams as a moisturizing agent for cooking and in plastics hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well a survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the eu was used in animal and bird feed
in modern times hemp is used for industrial purposes including paper textiles clothing biodegradable plastics construction as with hempcrete and insulation body products health food and bio-fuel
hemp seeds can be eaten raw ground into a meal sprouted or made into dried sprout powder made into hemp milk akin to soy milk and hemp juice prepared as tea and used in baking roughly 30-35% of the mass of the seeds can be extracted as hempseed oil which is rich in unsaturated fatty acids the fresh leaves can also be consumed in salads products include cereals frozen waffles hemp milk ice cream hemp tofu and nut butters a few companies produce value added hemp seed items that include the seed oils whole hemp grain which is sterilized by law in the united states where they import it from china and canada dehulled hemp seed the whole seed without the mineral rich outer shell hemp flour hemp cake a by-product of pressing the seed for oil and hemp protein powder even though hemp and marijuana are both made from the cannabis plant hemp seeds contain negligible levels of tetrahydrocannabinol thc which is the psychoactive substance in marijuana
within the uk the department for environment food and rural affairs defra has treated hemp as purely a non-food crop seed appears on the uk market as a legal food product and cultivation licenses are available for this purpose in north america hemp seed food products are sold typically in health food stores or through mail order the united states department of agriculture has concluded that the market potential for hemp seed as a food ingredient is unknown however it probably will remain a small market like those for sesame and poppy seeds in 2011 the us imported $11.5 million worth of legal hemp products up from $1.4 million in 2000 most of that driven by growth in hemp seed and hemp oil used in food products
hemp seeds are notable as a high-protein food source providing 73% of the daily value dv in a 100 g serving hempseed amino acid profile is comparable to other sources of protein such as meat milk eggs and soy protein digestibility corrected amino acid score values pdcaas which measure the degree to which a food for humans is a complete protein were 0.49-0.53 for whole hemp seed 0.46-0.51 for hemp seed meal and 0.63-0.66 for dehulled hemp seed
hemp seeds are also a rich source of the dietary minerals magnesium 160% dv zinc 77% dv and iron 53% dv and a good source of dietary fiber 13% dv
approximately 73% of the energy in hemp seeds is in the form of fats and essential fatty acids mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic oleic and alpha-linolenic acids

hemp oil like any food oil rich in essential fatty acids will spontaneously oxidize and turn rancid within a short period of time if not stored properly its shelf life is extended when stored in a dark airtight container and refrigerated
hemp fiber has been used extensively throughout history with production climaxing soon after being introduced to the new world items ranging from rope to fabrics to industrial materials were made from hemp fiber hemp was often used to make sail canvas and the word canvas derives from cannabis today a modest hemp fabric industry exists and hemp fibers can be used in clothing pure hemp has a texture similar to linen

concrete-like blocks made with hemp and lime have been used as an insulating material for construction such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements they must be supported by a brick wood or steel frame however hemp fibres are extremely strong and durable and have been shown to be usable as a replacement for wood for many jobs including creating very durable and breathable homes
the first example of the use of hempcrete was in 1986 in france with the renovation of the maison de la turque in nogent-sur-seine by the innovator charles rasetti in the uk hemp lime was first used in 2000 for the construction of two test dwellings in haverhill designed by modece architects who pioneered hemp's use in uk construction the hemp houses were monitored in comparison with other standard dwellings by bre completed in 2009 the renewable house is one of the most technologically advanced made from hemp-based materials the first us home made of hemp-based materials was completed in august 2010 in asheville north carolina
a panellized system of hemp-lime panels for use in building construction is currently under test in a european union funded research collaboration led by the university of bath the panels are being designed to assure high quality construction rapid on-site erection optimal hygrothermal performance from day one and energy and resource efficient buildings the 36-month-long work programme aims to refine product and manufacturing protocols produce data for certification and marketing warranty insurance cover and availability of finance it also includes the development of markets in britain france and spain

the first identified coarse paper made from hemp dates to the early western han dynasty two hundred years before the nominal invention of papermaking by cai lun who improved and standardized paper production using a range of inexpensive materials including hemp ends approximately 2000 years ago recycled hemp clothing rags and fishing nets were used as inputs for paper production
the saint petersburg russia paper mill of goznak opened in 1818 it used hemp as its main input material paper from the mill was used in the printing of bank notes stamped paper credit bills postal stamps bonds stocks and other watermarked paper
in 1916 us department of agriculture chief scientists lyster hoxie dewey and jason l merrill created paper made from hemp pulp and concluded that paper from hemp hurds was favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood the chemical composition of hemp hurds is similar to that of wood making hemp a good choice as a raw material for manufacturing paper modern research has not confirmed the positive finding about hemp hurds from 1916 a later book about hemp and other fibers by the same lh dewey1943 have no words about hemp as a raw material for production of paper dried hemp has about 57% cellulose the principal ingredient in paper compared to about 40-50% in wood hemp also has the advantage of a lower lignin content: hemp contains only 5-24% lignin against the 20-35% found in wood this lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process the actual production of hemp fiber in the us continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons year between 1934-35 the cultivation of hemp began to increase but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp
currently there is a small niche market for hemp pulp for example as cigarette paper hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp in 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper world hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume the total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons this can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum the cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the western world and because hemp is harvested once a year during august and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through this storage requires a lot of mostly manual handling of the bulky stalk bundles another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production while the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees only about 25% of the dried hemp stem — the bark called bast — contains the long strong fibers desirable for paper production all this accounts for a high raw material cost hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide a process today also commonly used for wood pulp
around the year 2000 the production quantity of flax and hemp pulp total 25000-30000 tons per year having been produced from approximately 37000-45000 tonnes fibers up to 80% of the produced pulp is used for specialty papers including 95% of cigarette paper only about 20% hemp fiber input goes into the standard pulp area and are here mostly in lower quality untreated oakum high shive content added wood pulps with hemp pulp alone the proportion of specialty papers probably at about 99% the market is considered saturated with little or no growth in this area
hemp jewelry is the product of knotting hemp twine through the practice of macramé hemp jewellery includes bracelets necklaces anklets rings watches and other adornments some jewellery features beads made from glass stone wood and bones the hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors there are many different stitches used to create hemp jewellery however the half knot and full knot stitches are most common
hemp rope was used in the age of sailing ships though the rope had to be protected by tarring since hemp rope has a propensity for breaking from rot as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior while seeming dry from the outside tarring was a labor-intensive process and earned sailors the nickname jack tar hemp rope was phased out when manila which does not require tarring became widely available manila is sometimes referred to as manila hemp but is not related to hemp it is abacá a species of banana
hemp shives are the core of the stem hemp hurds are broken parts of the core in the eu they are used for animal bedding horses for instance or for horticultural mulch industrial hemp is much more profitable if both fibers and shives or even seeds can be used
hemp can be used as a mop crop to clear impurities out of wastewater such as sewage effluent excessive phosphorus from chicken litter or other unwanted substances or chemicals additionally hemp is being used to clean contaminants at the chernobyl nuclear disaster site by way of a process which is known as phytoremediation - the process of clearing radioisotopes as well as a variety of other toxins from the soil water and air
hemp because of its height dense foliage and its high planting density as a crop is a very effective and long used method of killing tough weeds in farming by minimizing the pool of weed seeds of the soil using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides to help gain organic certification and to gain the benefits of crop rotation due to its rapid dense growth characteristics in some jurisdictions hemp is considered a prohibited noxious weed much like scotch broom it has been used extensively to kill weeds in agriculture
biodiesel can be made from the oils in hemp seeds and stalks and alcohol fuel ethanol or less commonly methanol from the fermentation of the whole plant biodiesel produced from hemp is sometimes known as hempoline
filtered hemp oil can be used directly to power diesel engines in 1892 rudolf diesel invented the diesel engine which he intended to power by a variety of fuels especially vegetable and seed oils which earlier were used for oil lamps ie the argand lamp
production of vehicle fuel from hemp is very small commercial biodiesel and biogas is typically produced from cereals coconuts palmseeds and cheaper raw materials like garbage wastewater dead plant and animal material animal feces and kitchen waste
hemp is usually planted between march and may in the northern hemisphere between september and november in the southern hemisphere it matures in about three to four months
millennia of selective breeding have resulted in varieties that look quite different also breeding since circa 1930 has focused quite specifically on producing strains which would perform very poorly as sources of drug material hemp grown for fiber is planted closely resulting in tall slender plants with long fibers until the early 1900s industrial hemp was a valuable crop used all over the world for its strong fibers and oil seeds today however the common perception of the industrial hemp plant is generally negative and associated with the drug marijuana this perception is the legacy of a century of powerful influences construing hemp as a dangerous drug even though it is not a drug and it has the potential to be a profitable alternative crop in the united states the public's perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product in spite of its vital importance prior to world war ii ideally according to britain's department for environment food and rural affairs the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering this early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality in these strains of industrial hemp the tetrahydrocannabinol thc content would have been very low
the seeds are sown from mid-april to mid-may with grain drills to 4–6 cm sowing depth hemp needs less fertilizer than corn does a total of 60–150 kg of nitrogen 40–140 kg phosphorus p2o5 and 75–200 kg of potassium 5 per acre for hemp fiber made before sowing and again later maybe three to four weeks when practiced especially in france double use of fiber and seed fertilization with nitrogen doses up to 100 kg   ha rather low organic fertilizers such as manure can utilize industrial hemp well neither weeds nor crop protection measures are necessary
a total of 26 varieties of hemp with low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol thc are certified by the european union eu they have unlike other types a very high fiber content of 30-40% in contrast to cannabis for medical use varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.2% thc and they are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana the most important cannabinoid in industrial hemp is cannabidiol cbd with a proportion of 1 to 5%
cannabis sativa l subsp sativa var sativa is the variety grown for industrial use while c sativa subsp indica generally has poor fiber quality and is primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes the major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance and the amount of δ-tetrahydrocannabinol thc secreted in a resinous mixture by epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes although they can also be distinguished genetically oilseed and fiber varieties of cannabis approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug not enough for any physical or psychological effects typically hemp contains below 0.3% thc while cultivars of cannabis grown for recreational use can contain anywhere from 2% to over 20%
smallholder plots are usually harvested by hand the plants are cut at 2 to 3 cm above the soil and left on the ground to dry mechanical harvesting is now common using specially adapted cutter-binders or simpler cutters
the cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry for up to four days this was traditionally followed by retting either water retting the bundled hemp floats in water or dew retting the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew and by molds and bacterial action modern processes use steam and machinery to separate the fiber a process known as thermomechanical pulping
for profitable hemp farming particularly deep humus-rich nutrient-rich soil with controlled water flow is preferable water logged acidic compressed or extremely light sandy soils primarily affect the early development of plants steep and high altitudes of more than 400 m above sea level are best avoided hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to -5 degrees c seeds can germinate down to 1-3 degrees hemp needs a lot of heat so earlier varieties come to maturation the water requirement is 300-500 l   kg dry matter up to 3 feet growing roots into the soil can also use water supplies from deeper soil layers worth noting is that the water requirement of hemp is at least 14 times lower than that of cotton which takes between 7 000-29 000 l kg according to wwf
hemp benefits crops grown after it for this reason it is generally grown before winter cereals advantageous changes are high weed suppression soil loosening by the large hemp root system and the positive effect on soil tilth since hemp is very self-compatible it can also be grown several years in a row in the same fields monoculture
hemp plants can be vulnerable to various pathogens including bacteria fungi nematodes viruses and other miscellaneous pathogens such diseases often lead to reduced fiber quality stunted growth and death of the plant these diseases rarely affect the yield of a hemp field so hemp production is not traditionally dependent on the use of pesticides
hemp is considered by a 1998 study in environmental economics to be environmentally friendly due to a decrease of land use and other environmental impacts indicating a possible decrease of ecological footprint in a us context compared to typical benchmarks a 2010 study however that compared the production of paper specifically from hemp and eucalyptus concluded that industrial hemp presents higher environmental impacts than eucalyptus paper however the article also highlights that there is scope for improving industrial hemp paper production hemp is also claimed to require few pesticides and no herbicides and it has been called a carbon negative raw material results indicate that high yield of hemp may require high total nutrient levels field plus fertilizer nutrients similar to a high yielding wheat crop

the world-leading producer of hemp is france which produces more than 70% of the world output china ranks second with approximately a quarter of the world production there is smaller production in europe chile and north korea over thirty countries produce industrial hemp including australia austria canada chile china denmark egypt finland germany great britain hungary india italy japan korea netherlands new zealand poland portugal romania russia slovenia spain sweden switzerland thailand turkey and ukraine
the united kingdom and germany resumed commercial production in the 1990s british production is mostly used as bedding for horses other uses are under development companies in canada the uk the united states and germany among many others process hemp seed into a growing range of food products and cosmetics many traditional growing countries still continue to produce textile-grade fibre
air dry stem yields in ontario have from 1998 and onward ranged from 2.6-14.0 tonnes of dry retted stalks per hectare 1-5.5 t ac at 12% moisture yields in kent county have averaged 8.75 t ha 3.5 t ac northern ontario crops averaged 6.1 t ha 2.5 t ac in 1998 statistic for the european union for 2008 to 2010 say that the average yield of hemp straw has varied between 6.3 and 7.3 ton per ha only a part of that is bast fiber approximately one tonne of bast fiber and 2-3 tonnes of core material can be decorticated from 3-4 tonnes of good quality dry retted straw for an annual yield of this level is it in ontario recommended to add nitrogen n:70–110 kg ha phosphate p2o5: up to 80 kg ha and potash k2o: 40–90 kg ha the average yield of dry hemp stalks in europe was 6 ton ha 2.4 ton ac in 2001 and 2002
fao argue that an optimum yield of hemp fiber is more than 2 tonnes per ha while average yields are around 650 kg ha
in the australian states of tasmania victoria queensland and most recently new south wales the state governments have issued licences to grow hemp for industrial use the state of tasmania pioneered the licensing of hemp in 1990 the state of victoria was an early adopter in 1998 and has reissued the regulation in 2008
queensland has allowed industrial production under licence since 2002 where the issuance is controlled under the drugs misuse act 1986 most recently new south wales now issues licences under a law the hemp industry regulations act 2008 no 58 that came into effect as of 6 november 2008
commercial production including cultivation of industrial hemp has been permitted in canada since 1998 under licenses and authorization issued by health canada 9,725 ha in 2004 5450 ha in 2009
in the early 1990s industrial hemp agriculture in north america began with the hemp awareness committee at the university of manitoba the committee worked with the provincial government to get research and development assistance and was able to obtain test plot permits from the canadian government their efforts led to the legalization of industrial hemp hemp with only minute amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol in canada and the first harvest in 1998
the cultivated area for hemp in the prairie provinces of canada is stable at about 90,000 acres over 2013-15
france is the world's biggest producer with 8,000 hectares cultivated 70-80% of the hemp fibre produced in europe in 2003 was used for specialty pulp for cigarette papers and technical applications about 15% is used in the automotive sector and 5-6% were used for insulation mats approximately 95% of hurds were used as animal bedding while almost 5% were used in the building sector in 2010 2011 a total of 11 000 ha was cultivated with hemp in the eu a decline compared with previous year
from the 1950s to the 1980s the soviet union was the world's largest producer of hemp 3,000 km² in 1970 the main production areas were in ukraine the kursk and orel regions of russia and near the polish border since its inception in 1931 the hemp breeding department at the institute of bast crops in hlukhiv glukhov ukraine has been one of the world's largest centers for developing new hemp varieties focusing on improving fiber quality per-hectare yields and low thc content
after the collapse of the soviet union the commercial cultivation of hemp declined sharply however it is estimated that at least 2.5 million acres of hemp grows wild in the russian far east and black sea regions
in the united kingdom cultivation licences are issued by the home office under the misuse of drugs act 1971 when grown for non-drug purposes hemp is referred to as industrial hemp and a common product is fibre for use in a wide variety of products as well as the seed for nutritional aspects and for the oil feral hemp or ditch weed is usually a naturalized fibre or oilseed strain of cannabis that has escaped from cultivation and is self-seeding
hemp was made illegal to grow without a permit in the us under the controlled substances act passed in 1970 because of its relation to marijuana and any imported hemp products must meet a zero tolerance level some states have made the cultivation of industrial hemp legal but farmers in north dakota hawaii kentucky maine maryland oregon california montana west virginia washington and vermont have not yet begun to grow it because of resistance from the federal drug enforcement administration in 2013 after the legalization of marijuana in the state several farmers in colorado planted and harvested several acres of hemp bringing in the first hemp crop in the united states in over half a century colorado vermont california and north dakota have passed laws enabling hemp licensure all four states are waiting for permission to grow hemp from the dea currently north dakota representatives are pursuing legal measures to force dea approval oregon has licensed industrial hemp as of august 2009 congress included a provision in the agricultural act of 2014 that allowed colleges and state agencies to grow and conduct research on hemp in states where it is legal
hemp is one of the earliest domesticated plants known it has been cultivated by many civilizations for over 12,000 years hemp use archaeologically dates back to the neolithic age in china with hemp fiber imprints found on yangshao culture pottery dating from the 5th millennium bc the chinese later used hemp to make clothes shoes ropes and an early form of paper the classical greek historian herodotus ca 480 bc reported that the inhabitants of scythia would often inhale the vapors of hemp-seed smoke both as ritual and for their own pleasurable recreation
textile expert elizabeth wayland barber summarizes the historical evidence that cannabis sativa grew and was known in the neolithic period all across the northern latitudes from europe germany switzerland austria romania ukraine to east asia tibet and china but textile use of cannabis sativa does not surface for certain in the west until relatively late namely the iron age i strongly suspect however that what catapulted hemp to sudden fame and fortune as a cultigen and caused it to spread rapidly westwards in the first millennium bc was the spread of the habit of pot-smoking from somewhere in south-central asia where the drug-bearing variety of the plant originally occurred the linguistic evidence strongly supports this theory both as to time and direction of spread and as to cause
jews living in palestine in the 2nd century were familiar with the cultivation of hemp as witnessed by a reference to it in the mishna kil'ayim 2:5 as a variety of plant along with arum that sometimes takes as many as three years to grow from a seedling in late medieval germany and italy hemp was employed in cooked dishes as filling in pies and tortes or boiled in a soup hemp in later europe was mainly cultivated for its fibers and was used for ropes on many ships including those of christopher columbus the use of hemp as a cloth was centered largely in the countryside with higher quality textiles being available in the towns
the spaniards brought hemp to the western hemisphere and cultivated it in chile starting about 1545 however in may 1607 hempe was among the crops gabriel archer observed being cultivated by the natives at the main powhatan village where richmond virginia is now situated and in 1613 samuell argall reported wild hemp better than that in england growing along the shores of the upper potomac as early as 1619 the first virginia house of burgesses passed an act requiring all planters in virginia to sow both english and indian hemp on their plantations the puritans are first known to have cultivated hemp in new england in 1645
george washington pushed for the growth of hemp and even grew hemp himself as it was a cash crop commonly used to make rope and fabric in may 1765 he noted in his diary about the sowing of seeds each day until mid-april then he recounts the harvest in october which he grew 27 bushels that year
there is some speculation that george washington smoked the flower of the cannabis plant in order to achieve a recreational high like all farmers washington probably sampled the quality and potency of what he grew and he may have used this hemp to treat his chronic tooth aches but there is no evidence in any of his writings that he grew hemp for anything other than industrial purposes it is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from washington's diary which reads began to seperate sic the male from the female hemp at do&—rather too late is evidence that he was trying to grow female plants for the thc found in the flowers however the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that this may arise from their the male being coarser and the stalks larger in subsequent days he describes soaking the hemp to make the fibers usable and harvesting the seeds suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes not recreational
george washington also imported the indian hemp plant from asia which was used for fiber and by some growers for intoxicating resin production in a letter to william pearce who managed the plants for him washington says what was done with the indian hemp plant from last summer it ought all of it to be sown again that not only a stock of seed sufficient for my own purposes might have been raised but to have disseminated seed to others as it is more valuable than common hemp
additional presidents known to have farmed hemp include thomas jefferson james madison james monroe andrew jackson zachary taylor and franklin pierce
historically hemp production had made up a significant portion of antebellum kentucky's economy before the american civil war many slaves worked on plantations producing hemp
in 1937 the marihuana tax act of 1937 was passed in the united states levying a tax on anyone who dealt commercially in cannabis hemp or marijuana the passing of the act to destroy the us hemp industry has been disputed to involve businessmen andrew mellon randolph hearst and the du pont family
one claim is that hearst believed that his extensive timber holdings were threatened by the invention of the decorticator which he feared would allow hemp to become a cheap substitute for the paper pulp used for newspaper historical research indicates this fear was unfounded because improvements of the decorticators in the 1930s – machines that separated the fibers from the hemp stem – could not make hemp fiber a cheaper substitute for fibers from other sources further decorticators did not perform satisfactorily in commercial production
another claim is that mellon secretary of the treasury and the wealthiest man in america at that time had invested heavily in dupont's new synthetic fiber nylon and believed that the replacement of the traditional resource hemp was integral to the new product's success the company dupont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp nylon became immediately a scarce commodity nylon had characteristics that could be used for toothbrushes sold from 1938 and very thin nylon fiber could compete with silk and rayon in various textiles normally not produced from hemp fiber such as very thin stockings for women
hemp was used extensively by the unit

environmental economics - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
environmental economics is a sub-field of economics that is concerned with environmental issues quoting from the national bureau of economic research environmental economics program:
 environmental economics  undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world  particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution water quality toxic substances solid waste and global warming
environmental economics is distinguished from ecological economics in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving natural capital one survey of german economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought with ecological economists emphasizing strong sustainability and rejecting the proposition that natural capital can be substituted by human-made capital


central to environmental economics is the concept of market failure market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently as stated by hanley shogren and white 2007 in their textbook environmental economics: a market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare a wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off common forms of market failure include externalities non-excludability and non-rivalry
an externality exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price an externality can be positive or negative but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics for instance water seepage in residential buildings happen in upper floor affect the lower floor or a firm emitting pollution will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others as a result pollution may occur in excess of the 'socially efficient' level which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution a classic definition influenced by kenneth arrow and james meade is provided by heller and starrett 1976 who define an externality as “a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of pareto efficiency” in economic terminology externalities are examples of market failures in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome
when it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource the resource is either called a common property resource when there is rivalry for the resource such that one person's use of the resource reduces others' opportunity to use the resource or a public good when use of the resource is non-rivalrous in either case of non-exclusion market allocation is likely to be inefficient
these challenges have long been recognized hardin's 1968 concept of the tragedy of the commons popularized the challenges involved in non-exclusion and common property commons refers to the environmental asset itself common property resource or common pool resource refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams and open-access implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns
the basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons they can end up expending too much effort over harvesting a resource eg a fishery hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights leading to environmental degradation see however ostrom's 1990 work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self-governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons
the mitigation of climate change effects is an example of a public good where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price this is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non-rival and non-excludable such efforts are non-rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys they are non-excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded a country's incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can free ride off the efforts of other countries over a century ago swedish economist knut wicksell 1896 first discussed how public goods can be under-provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them

assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from natural resources or ecosystem services see the nature section of ecological economics non-use values include existence option and bequest values for example some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services the existence of these species may have an option value as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose certain plants may be researched for drugs individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children
use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior such as the cost of taking recreational trips or using hedonic methods in which values are estimated based on observed prices non-use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as contingent valuation or choice modelling contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment willingness to pay or their willingness to accept wta compensation for the destruction of the environmental good hedonic pricing examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices traveling expenses and payments to visit parks
solutions advocated to correct such externalities include:
environmental economics is related to ecological economics but there are differences most environmental economists have been trained as economists they apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems many of which are related to so-called market failures—circumstances wherein the invisible hand of economics is unreliable most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services and vice versa this field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of ecology ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to environmental problems and focuses more explicitly on long-term environmental sustainability and issues of scale
environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a price system ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use money as a primary arbiter of decisions these two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings
another context in which externalities apply is when globalization permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with biodiversity to undercut prices of another who is - creating a race to the bottom in regulations and conservation this in turn may cause loss of natural capital with consequent erosion water purity problems diseases desertification an

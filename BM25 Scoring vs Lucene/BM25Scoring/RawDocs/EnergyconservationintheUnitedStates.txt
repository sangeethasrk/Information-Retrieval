energy conservation in the united states - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the united states is the second-largest single consumer of energy in the world the us department of energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors: transportation residential commercial and industrial
energy usage in transportation and residential sectors about half of us energy consumption is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by businesses entities and other facility managers national energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors


the transportation sector includes all vehicles used for personal or freight transportation of the energy used in this sector approximately 65% is consumed by gasoline-powered vehicles primarily personally owned diesel-powered transport trains merchant ships heavy trucks etc consumes about 20% and air traffic consumes most of the remaining 15% the two oil supply crisis of the 1970s spurred the creation in 1975 of the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe program which required auto manufacturers to meet progressively higher fleet fuel economy targets the next decade saw dramatic improvements in fuel economy mostly the result of reductions in vehicle size and weight which originated in the late 1970s along with the transition to front wheel drive these gains eroded somewhat after 1990 due to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles pickup trucks and minivans which fall under the more lenient light truck cafe standard
in addition to the cafe program the us government has tried to encourage better vehicle efficiency through tax policy since 2002 taxpayers have been eligible for income tax credits for gas electric hybrid vehicles a gas-guzzler tax has been assessed on manufacturers since 1978 for cars with exceptionally poor fuel economy while this tax remains in effect it generates very little revenue as overall fuel economy has improved
another focus in gasoline conservation is reducing the number of miles driven an estimated 40% of american automobile use is associated with daily commuting many urban areas offer subsidized public transportation to reduce commuting traffic and encourage carpooling by providing designated high-occupancy vehicle lanes and lower tolls for cars with multiple riders in recent years telecommuting has also become a viable alternative to commuting for some jobs but in 2003 only 3.5% of workers were telecommuters ironically hundreds of thousands of american and european workers have been replaced by workers in asia who telecommute from thousands of miles away
fuel economy-maximizing behaviors also help reduce fuel consumption among the most effective are moderate as opposed to aggressive driving driving at lower speeds using cruise control and turning off a vehicle's engine at stops rather than idling a vehicle's gas mileage decreases rapidly with increasing highway speeds normally above 55 miles per hour though the exact number varies by vehicle this is because aerodynamic forces are proportionally related to the square of an object's speed when the speed is doubled drag quadruples according to the us department of energy doe as a rule of thumb each 5 mph 8.0 km h you drive over 60 mph 97 km h is similar to paying an additional $0.30 per gallon for gas the exact speed at which a vehicle achieves its highest efficiency varies based on the vehicle's drag coefficient frontal area surrounding air speed and the efficiency and gearing of a vehicle's drive train and transmission
the residential sector refers to all private residences including single-family homes apartments manufactured homes and dormitories energy use in this sector varies significantly across the country due to regional climate differences and different regulation on average about half of the energy used in us homes is expended on space conditioning ie heating and cooling
the efficiency of furnaces and air conditioners has increased steadily since the energy crises of the 1970s the 1987 national appliance energy conservation act authorized the department of energy to set minimum efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment and other appliances each year based on what is technologically feasible and economically justified beyond these minimum standards the environmental protection agency epa awards the energy star designation to appliances that exceed industry efficiency averages by an epa-specified percentage
despite technological improvements many american lifestyle changes have put higher demands on heating and cooling resources the average size of homes built in the united states has increased significantly from 1,500 sq ft 140 m in 1970 to 2,300 sq ft 210 m in 2005 the single-person household has become more common as has central air conditioning: 23% of households had central air conditioning in 1978 that figure rose to 55% by 2001
as furnace efficiency gets higher appropriate matching of equipment size to distribution system capacity and building load becomes more critical to optimizing equipment ability to maximize efficient operation installing much lower output high efficiency replacement equipment offers opportunity for huge comfort and savings gains but improving the building envelope through air sealing and adding more insulation advanced windows etc should be explored concurrently or before replacement equipment design stage the passive house approach produces superinsulated buildings that approach zero net energy consumption improving the building envelope can also be cheaper than replacing a furnace or air conditioner
even lower cost improvements include weatherization which is frequently subsidized by utilities or state federal tax credits as are programmable thermostats consumers have also been urged to adopt a wider indoor temperature range eg 65 °f 18 °c in the winter 80 °f 27 °c in the summer
one underutilized but potentially very powerful means to reduce household energy consumption is to provide real-time feedback to homeowners so they can effectively alter their energy using behavior low cost energy feedback displays such as the energy detective or wattvision have become available a study of a similar device deployed in 500 homes in ontario canada by hydro one showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group
standby power used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off accounts for an estimated 5 to 10% of household electricity consumption adding an estimated $3 billion to annual energy costs in the usa in the average home 75% of the electricity used to power home electronics is consumed while the products are turned off
energy usage in some homes may vary widely from these averages for example milder regions such as the southern us and pacific coast of the usa need far less energy for space conditioning than new york city or chicago on the other hand air conditioning energy use can be quite high in hot-arid regions southwest and hot-humid zones southeast in milder climates such as san diego lighting energy may easily consume up to 40% of total energy certain appliances such as a waterbed hot tub or pre-1990 refrigerator use significant amounts of electricity however recent trends in home entertainment equipment can make a large difference in household energy use for instance a 50 lcd television average on-time= 6 hours a day may draw 300 watts less than a similarly sized plasma system in most residences no single appliance dominates and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas in order to achieve substantial energy savings however ground air and water source heat pump systems solar heating systems and evaporative coolers are among the more energy efficient environmentally clean and cost-effective space conditioning and domestic hot water systems available environmental protection agency and can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 69%
current best practices in building design construction and retrofitting result in homes that are profoundly more energy conserving than ave

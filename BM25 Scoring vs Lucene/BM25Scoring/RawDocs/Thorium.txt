thorium - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
thorium is a chemical element with symbol th and atomic number 90 a radioactive actinide metal thorium is one of only two significantly radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as a primordial element the other being uranium it was discovered in 1828 by the norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist morten thrane esmark and identified by the swedish chemist jöns jacob berzelius who named it after thor the norse god of thunder
a thorium atom has 90 protons and therefore 90 electrons of which four are valence electrons thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when exposed to air thorium is weakly radioactive: all its known isotopes are unstable with the seven naturally occurring ones thorium-227 228 229 230 231 232 and 234 having half-lives between 25.52 hours and 14.05 billion years thorium-232 which has 142 neutrons is the most stable isotope of thorium and accounts for nearly all natural thorium with the other five natural isotopes occurring only in traces: it decays very slowly through alpha decay to radium-228 starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at lead-208 thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in the earth's crust and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare earth metals
thorium was once commonly used as the light source in gas mantles and as an alloying material but these applications have declined due to concerns about its radioactivity thorium is still widely used as an alloying element in tig welding electrodes at a rate of 1%-2% mix with tungsten it remains popular as a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation thorium and uranium are the only significantly radioactive elements with major commercial applications that do not rely on their radioactivity thorium is predicted to be able to replace uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors but only a few thorium reactors have yet been completed


thorium is a soft paramagnetic bright silvery radioactive actinide metal in the periodic table it is located to the right of the actinide actinium to the left of the actinide protactinium and below the lanthanide cerium pure thorium is soft very ductile and can be cold-rolled swaged and drawn
the measured properties of thorium vary widely depending on the amount of impurities in the sample used: the major impurity is usually thorium dioxide tho2 the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide its density has been calculated to be 11.724 g cm while experimental measurements give values between 11.5 and 11.66 g cm: these values lie intermediate between those of its neighbours actinium 10.07 g cm and protactinium 15.37 g cm showing the continuity of trends across the actinide series however thorium's melting point of 1750 °c is above both that of actinium 1227 °c and that of protactinium 1562±15 °c: the melting points of the actinides do not have a clear dependence on their number of f electrons although there is a smooth trend downward from thorium to plutonium where the number of f electrons increases from zero to six thorium is a soft metal having a bulk modulus of 54 gpa comparable to those of tin and scandium the hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire thorium becomes superconductive below 1.40 k nevertheless while thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium it is harder than either of them among the actinides thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density second only to actinium the thermal expansion electrical and thermal conductivities of thorium protactinium and uranium are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals
thorium can also form alloys with many other metals with chromium and uranium it forms eutectic mixtures and thorium is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium
thorium is a highly reactive metal at standard temperature and pressure thorium is slowly attacked by water but does not readily dissolve in most common acids the exception being hydrochloric acid it dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions if these are not present passivation can occur at high temperatures it is easily attacked by oxygen hydrogen nitrogen the halogens and sulfur it can also form binary compounds with carbon and phosphorus when thorium dissolves in hydrochloric acid a black residue probably thoohclh is left behind
finely divided thorium metal presents a fire hazard due to its pyrophoricity and must therefore be handled carefully when heated in air thorium turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light to produce the dioxide in bulk the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow although corrosion may eventually occur after several months most thorium samples are however contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide which greatly accelerates corrosion such samples slowly tarnish in air becoming gray and finally black
the most important oxidation state of thorium is +4 represented in compounds such as thorium dioxide tho2 and thorium tetrafluoride thf4 although some compounds are known with thorium in lower formal oxidation states owing to thoriumiv's lack of electrons on 6d and 5f orbitals the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless
in aqueous solution thorium occurs exclusively as the tetrapositive aqua ion thh2o9 which has tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry: at ph < 3 the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation the th–o bond distance is 245 ± 1 pm the coordination number of th is 10.8 ± 0.5 the effective charge is 3.82 and the second coordination sphere contains 13.4 water molecules the th ion is relatively large and is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 å as a result thorium salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyze weaker than that of many multiply charged ions such as fe the distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility not only in water but also in polar organic solvents
thorium has been shown to activate carbon–hydrogen bonds forming unusual compounds thorium atoms can also bond to more atoms than any other element: for instance in the compound thorium aminodiboranate thorium has a coordination number of fifteen
a thorium atom has 90 electrons of which four are valence electrons four atomic orbitals are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy: 5f 6d 7s and 7p however the 7p orbital is greatly destabilized and hence it is not occupied in the ground state of any thorium ion despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table it has an anomalous rn6d7s electron configuration in the ground state however in metallic thorium the rn5f6d7s configuration is a low-lying excited state and hence the 5f orbitals contribute existing in a rather broad energy band
the ground-state electron configurations of thorium ions are as follows: th rn6d7s th rn5f6d th rn5f th rn this shows the increasing stabilization of the 5f orbital as ion charge increases however this stabilization is insufficient to chemically stabilize th with its lone 5f valence electron and therefore the stable and most common form of thorium in chemicals is th with all four valence electrons lost leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon the first ionization potential of thorium was measured to be 6.08 ± 0.12 ev in 1974 more recent measurements have refined this to 6.3067 ev
although thorium has 6 naturally occurring isotopes none of these isotopes are stable however one isotope th is relatively stable with a half-life of 14.05 billion years considerably longer than the age of the earth and even slightly longer than the generally accepted age of the universe about 13.8 billion years this isotope is the longest-lived of all isotopes with more than 83 protons and makes up nearly all natural thorium as such thorium is most commonly considered to be mononuclidic however in deep seawaters the isotope th becomes significant enough that iupac reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013 in fact uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the th isotope thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition consisting largely of th and a little th and thus an atomic mass can be given which is 232.03774 u
th is the longest-lived isotope in the 4n decay chain which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by 4 begins with the alpha decay of th to ra and terminates at stable pb and its longevity means that the isotopes in its decay chain still exist in nature as radiogenic nuclides despite their short half-lives as such natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract its useful daughter nuclides such as lead-212 pb which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy
thirty radioisotopes have been characterized which range in mass number from 209 to 238 the most stable of them after th are th with a half-life of 75,380 years th with a half-life of 7,340 years th with a half-life of 1.92 years th with a half-life of 24.10 days and th with a half-life of 18.68 days: all of these isotopes occur in nature as trace radioisotopes due to their presence in the decay chains of th u u and np produced in minute traces in nuclear reactions in uranium ores all of the remaining thorium isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes the isotope th has a nuclear isomer or metastable state with a remarkably low excitation energy recently measured to be 7.6 ± 0.5 ev
in the early history of the study of radioactivity the different natural isotopes of thorium were given different names in this scheme th was named radioactinium rdac th radiothorium rdth th ionium io th uranium y uy th thorium th and th uranium x1 ux1 when it was realized that all of these are isotopes of thorium many of these names fell out of use and thorium came to refer to all isotopes not just th however the name ionium is still encountered for th in the context of ionium-thorium dating
different isotopes of thorium behave identically chemically but do have slightly differing physical properties: for example the densities of th th th and th in g·cm are respectively expected to be 11.524 11.575 11.626 and 11.727 the isotope th is expected to be fissionable with a bare critical mass of 2839 kg although with steel reflectors this value could drop to 994 kg while th the most common thorium isotope is not fissionable it is fertile as it can be converted to fissile u using neutron capture
in 1815 the swedish chemist jöns jakob berzelius analyzed a mineral from a copper mine in falun assuming that a new element was contained in the mineral he named the supposed element thorium after thor the norse god of thunder however the mineral later proved to actually be an yttrium mineral primarily composed of yttrium orthophosphate as the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken as being a new element the mineral was named kenotime from the greek words κενός vain and τιμή honor which became xenotime as a misprint
in 1828 morten thrane esmark found a black mineral on løvøya island norway and gave a sample to his father jens esmark a noted mineralogist the elder esmark was not able to identify it and sent a sample to the swedish chemist jöns jakob berzelius for examination berzelius determined that it contained a new element he published his findings in 1829 berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery thus he named the source mineral thorite which has the chemical composition thusio4
in dmitri mendeleev's 1869 periodic table thorium and the rare earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals this reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare earth metals were divalent with the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group iv in 1871 which contained the modern carbon group titanium group cerium and thorium because their maximum oxidation state was +4 while cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series it was not until 1945 that glenn t seaborg realized that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium and filling a fourth d-block row
thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898 independently by the polish-french physicist marie curie and the german chemist gerhard carl schmidt between 1900 and 1903 ernest rutherford and frederick soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements this observation led to the identification of half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity
although thorium was discovered in 1828 it had no applications until 1885 when carl auer von welsbach invented the gas mantle after 1885 many applications were found for thorium and its compounds in recent decades however most of these applications that do not depend on thorium's radioactivity have declined due to safety and environmental concerns
thorium-232 is a primordial nuclide having existed in its current form for over 4.5 billion years predating the formation of the earth it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the r-process and scattered across the galaxy by supernovae its radioactive decay produces a significant amount of the earth's internal heat
natural thorium is essentially isotopically pure th which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe if the source contains no uranium the only other thorium isotope present would be th which occurs in the decay chain of thorium-232 the thorium series: the ratio of th to th would be under 10 however if uranium is present tiny traces of several other isotopes will be present: th and th from the decay chain of uranium-235 the actinium series and slightly larger but still tiny traces of th and th from the decay chain of uranium-238 the uranium series th is also been produced in the decay chain of np the neptunium series: while all primordial np is extinct it is still produced today as a result of nuclear reactions in uranium ores th is mostly produced as a daughter of artificial uranium-233 itself produced from neutron irradiation of th due to its extreme rarity in nature
on earth thorium is not a rare element as was previously thought having an abundance comparable to that of lead and molybdenum twice that of arsenic and thrice that of tin in nature it occurs in the +4 oxidation state together with uraniumiv zirconiumiv hafniumiv and ceriumiv but also with the scandium yttrium and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar ionic radii however thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals
thorium minerals occur on all continents thorium is several times more abundant in earth's crust than all isotopes of uranium combined and thorium-232 is several hundred times more abundant than uranium-235 because of thorium's radioactivity minerals containing significant quantities of thorium are often metamict their crystal structure having been partially or totally destroyed by the alpha radiation produced in the radioactive decay of thorium an extreme example is ekanite cafepb2thusi8o20 which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to thorium being an essential part of its chemical composition
monazite is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide and contains 2.5% thorium it is a chemically unreactive phosphate mineral that has a high specific gravity and is found as yellow or brown monazite sand its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it allanite can have 0.1–2% thorium and zircon up to 0.4% thorium
thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral thorianite which usually contains up to 12% tho2 however due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide the two actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the tho2 content thorite or thorium silicate thsio4 also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered in thorium silicate minerals the th and sio4− 4 ions are often replaced with m m = sc y ln and phosphate po3− 4 ions respectively
thorium is extracted mostly from monazite: thorium diphosphate thpo42 is reacted with nitric acid and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the ph in sulfate solution
in another extraction method monazite is decomposed with a 45% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 140 °c mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first filtered at 80 °c washed with water and dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid next the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to ph = 5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide thoh4 contaminated with ~3% of rare-earth hydroxides the remaining rare-earth hydroxides remain in solution thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements an efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents:
metallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide or chloride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere:
sometimes thorium is extracted by electrolysis of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800 °c in a graphite crucible highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process
in air thorium turnings burn to form the simple dioxide tho2 also called thoria or thorina thoria a refractory material has the highest melting point 3390 °c of all known oxides it is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts readily with water and many gases when heated it emits intense blue light which becomes white when mixed with its lighter homolog cerium dioxide ceo2 ceria: this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles reports of thorium peroxide initially supposed to be th2o7 and be formed from reacting thorium salts with hydrogen peroxide were later discovered to contain both peroxide anions and the anions of the reacting thorium salt thorium monoxide has recently been produced through laser ablation of thorium in the presence of oxygen this highly polar molecule has the largest known internal electric field
thorium hydroxide thoh4 can be prepared by adding a hydroxide of ammonium or an alkali metal to a thorium salt solution where it appears as a gelatinous precipitate that will dissolve in dilute acids among other substances it can also be prepared by electrolysis of thorium nitrates it is stable from 260–450 °c at 470 °c and above it continuously decomposes to become thoria it easily absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the hydrated carbonate thoco3·xh2o and under high-pressure conditions in a carbon dioxide atmosphere thco32·0.5h2o or thoh2co3·2h2o
all four thorium tetrahalides are known as are some low-valent bromides and iodides additionally many related polyhalide ions are also known thorium tetrafluoride thf4 is most easily produced by reacting various thorium salts thoria or thorium hydroxide with hydrogen fluoride: methods that involve steps in the aqueous phase are more difficult because they result in hydroxide and oxide fluorides that have to be reduced with hydrogen fluoride or fluorine gas it has a monoclinic crystal structure and is isotypic with zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride where the th ions are coordinated with f ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms it is a white hygroscopic powder: at temperatures above 500 °c it reacts with atmospheric moisture to produce the oxyfluoride thof2
thorium tetrachloride thcl4 can be produced in many ways the usual method is crystallization from an aqueous solution and then heating the product above 100 °c to dehydrate it further purification can be achieved by subliming it its melting and boiling points are respectively 770 °c and 921 °c it undergoes a phase transition at 405 °c with a low-temperature α phase and high-temperature β phase nevertheless the β phase usually persists below the transition temperature both phases crystallize in the tetragonal crystal system and the structural differences are small below −203 °c a low-temperature form exists with a complex structure
thorium tetrabromide thbr4 can be produced either by reacting thoriumiv hydroxide with hydrobromic acid which has the disadvantage of often resulting in products contaminated with oxybromides or by directly reacting bromine or hydrogen bromide with thorium metal or compounds the product can then be purified by sublimation at 600 °c in a vacuum the melting and boiling points are 679 °c and 857 °c like the tetrachloride both an α and a β form exist and both are isotypic to the tetrachloride forms though the phase transition here occurs at 426 °c there is also a low-temperature form incomplete reports of the lower bromides thbr3 thbr2 and thbr are known the last only known as a gas-phase molecular species: thbr3 and thbr2 are known to be very reactive and at high temperatures disproportionate
thorium tetraiodide thi4 is prepared by direct reaction of the elements in a sealed silica ampoule water and oxygen must not be present or else thoi2 and tho2 can contaminate the product it has a different crystal structure from the other tetrahalides being monoclinic the lower iodides thi3 and thi2 can be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal thi is also predicted to form as an intermediate in the dissociation of thi4 to thorium metal these do not contain thiii and thii but instead contain th and could be more clearly formulated as thi3e and thi2e2 respectively depending on the amount of time allowed for the reaction between thi4 and thorium two modifications of thi3 can be produced: shorter times give thin lustrous rods of α-thi3 while longer times give small β-thi3 crystals with green to brass-colored luster thi2 also has two modifications which can be produced by varying the reaction temperature: at 600 °c α-thi2 is formed while a reaction temperature of 700–850 °c produces β-thi2 which has a golden luster
many polynary halides with the alkali metals barium thallium and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides chlorides and bromides for example when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid th forms the complex anion thf2− 6 which precipitates as an insoluble salt k2thf6
the heavier chalcogens sulfur selenium and tellurium are known to form thorium chalcogenides many of which have more complex structure than the oxides apart from several binary compounds the oxychalcogenides thos yellow those and thote are also known the five binary thorium sulfides – ths lustrous metallic th2s3 brown metallic th7s12 black ths2 purple-brown and th2s5 orange-brown – may be produced by reacting hydrogen sulfide with thorium its halides or thoria the last if carbon is present: they all hydrolyze in acidic solutions the six selenides are analogous to the sulfides with the addition of thse3 the five tellurides are also similar to the sulfides and selenides although th2te5 is unknown but have slightly different crystal structures: for example ths has the sodium chloride structure but thte has the caesium chloride structure
all five chemically characterized pnictogens nitrogen phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth also form compounds with thorium three thorium nitrides are known: thn th3n4 and th2n3 the brass-colored th3n4 is most easily produced by heating thorium metal in a nitrogen atmosphere th3n4 and th2n3 decompose to the golden-yellow thn and indeed thn can often be seen covering the surface of th3n4 samples because th3n4 is hygroscopic and water vapor in the air can decompose it: thin films of thn are metallic in character and like all other actinide mononitrides has the sodium chloride structure thn is also a low-temperature superconductor all three nitrides can react with thorium halides to form halide nitrides thnx x = f cl br i the heavier pnictogens also form analogous monopnictides except thbi which has not yet been structurally characterized the other well-characterized thorium pnictides are th3p4 th2p11 thp7 th3as4 thas2 th3sb4 thsb2 and thbi2
thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides thh2 and th4h15 the latter of which is superconducting below the transition temperature of 7.5–8 k at standard temperature and pressure it conducts electricity like a metal finely divided thorium metal reacts very readily with hydrogen at standard conditions but large pieces may need to be heated to 300–400 °c for a reaction to take place around 850 °c the reaction forming first thh2 and then th4h15 occurs without breaking up the structure of the thorium metal thorium hydrides react readily with oxygen or steam to form thoria and at 250–350 °c quickly react with hydrogen halides sulfides phosphides and nitrides to form the corresponding thorium binary compounds
three binary thorium borides are known: thb6 thb4 and thb12 the last is isotypic with ub12 while reports of thb66 and thb76 exist they may simply be thorium-stabilized boron allotropes the three known binary thorium carbides are thc2 th2c3 and thc: all are produced by reacting thorium or thoria with carbon thc and thc2 are refractory solids and have melting points over 2600 °c
many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known such as the perchlorates sulfates sulfites nitrates carbonates phosphates vanadates molybdates chromates and other oxometallates many of which are known in hydrated forms these are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste but most have not yet been fully characterized especially on their structural properties for example thorium perchlorate is very water-soluble and crystallizes from acidic solutions as the tetrahydrate thclo44·4h2o while thorium nitrate forms tetra- and pentahydrates is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds
like many of the early and middle actinides thorium through americium and also expected for curium thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex thc8h82 thorocene it is isotypic with the more well-known analogous uranium compound uranocene it can be prepared by reacting k2c8h8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran thf at the temperature of dry ice or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with mgc8h8 it is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190 °c many other organothorium compounds are known many involving the cyclopentadienyl anion some coordination complexes with carboxylates and acetylacetonates are also known although these are not organothorium compounds
due to thorium's radioactivity the most important possible use of thorium is in the thorium fuel cycle as a nuclear fuel and in radiometric dating
in thermal breeder reactors the fertile isotope th the most common thorium isotope is bombarded by slow neutrons undergoing neutron capture to become th which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first pa and then the fissile u:
u is fissile and hence can be used as a nuclear fuel in much the same way as the more-commonly used u or pu when u undergoes nuclear fission the neutrons emitted can strike further th nuclei restarting the cycle this closely parallels the uranium fuel cycle in fast breeder reactors where u undergoes neutron capture to become u beta decaying to first np and then fissile pu the main advantage of the thorium fuel cycle is that thorium is more abundant than uranium and hence can satisfy world energy demands for longer
an added advantage u and pu enjoy over all other fissile nuclei except the naturally occurring u is that they can be bred from the naturally-occurring quantity isotopes th and u additionally u is easily detected can be mixed with u to prevent direct use in nuclear weapons and limit nuclear proliferation and has a higher neutron yield than pu thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing reactor core because thoria has a higher melting point higher thermal conductivity and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide uo2: thoria is also more chemically stable as unlike uranium dioxide it does not further oxidize
a single neutron capture by u would produce transuranic waste along with it fissile pu whereas six captures are generally necessary to do so from th 98–99% of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either u or u so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced because of this thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide mox fuels to minimize the generation of transuranics and maximize the destruction of plutonium a disadvantage of the thorium fuel cycle is the need to neutron irradiate and process natural th before these advantages become real and this requires more advanced technology than the presently used fuels based on uranium and plutonium nevertheless advances are being made in this technology another common criticism centers around the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle: some entities like the nuclear energy agency go further and predict that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance—a situation which trevor findlay predicts will persist in the coming decades
in 1997 the us energy department underwrote research into thorium fuel and research also was begun in 1996 by the international atomic energy agency iaea to study the use of thorium reactors nuclear scientist alvin radkowsky of tel aviv university in israel founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors which included other companies: raytheon nuclear inc brookhaven national laboratory and the kurchatov institute in moscow radkowsky was chief scientist in the us nuclear submarine program directed by admiral hyman rickover and later headed the design team that built the usa's first civilian nuclear power plant at shippingport pennsylvania which was a scaled-up version of the first naval reactor the third shippingport core initiated in 1977 bred thorium even earlier examples of reactors using fuel with thorium exist including the first core at the indian point energy center in 1962 however in most countries uranium was relatively abundant and hence research into thorium fuel waned for a while a notable exception was india's three-stage nuclear power programme in the twenty-first century thorium's potential for improving proliferation resistance and waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle currently some countries such as india are developing technology for thorium nuclear reactors
two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uranium-thorium dating involving the decay of u to th ionium and ionium-thorium dating which measures the ratio of th to th these rely on the fact that th is a primordial radioisotope but th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of u uranium-thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of u and th relative to the age of the earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of u into th which very quickly becomes the longer-lived pa and this process is often used to check the results of uranium-thorium dating uranium-thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral because while uranium is rather soluble in water thorium and protactinium are not and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments from which their ratios are measured the scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years ionium-thorium dating is a related process which exploits the insolubility of thorium both th and th and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of th to th both of these d

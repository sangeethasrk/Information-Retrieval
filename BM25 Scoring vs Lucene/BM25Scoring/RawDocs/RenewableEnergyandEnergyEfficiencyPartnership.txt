renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership reeep is a vienna-based non-profit non-governmental organisation that aims to accelerate the marketplace for renewable energy and energy efficiency with a particular emphasis on the emerging markets and developing countries its primary focus is the scaling up of clean energy business models
reeep was originally launched by the government of the united kingdom along with other partners at the johannesburg world summit on sustainable development wssd in august 2002
it pursues its market catalyst role in three ways:
to date the organisation has been funded primarily by governments including: australia austria canada germany ireland italy spain switzerland the netherlands the united kingdom the united states and the european commission


in 2002 accelerating the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies was one of the priorities of a large group of countries at the wssd margaret beckett then uk minister for the environment announced the initiative to form reeep at the summit’s closing session it grew from an agreement with other committed governments businesses and ngos to deliver wssd commitments others in particular to take forward the key recommendations of the g8 renewable energy task force
from january 2003 until may 2004 the reeep was housed within the uk foreign and commonwealth office fco where it continued following the un type ii partnership process of stakeholder consultation in june 2004 reeep obtained formal legal non-profit status as an ngo and has since been located at the un complex in vienna austria
since its inception as an independent entity reeep has offered funding to more than 180 projects the majority have targeted emerging markets such as india china south africa and brazil
to date reeep projects have addressed two key barriers to clean energy development:
reeep finances projects which promote policy and regulatory frameworks that provide stable long-term conditions for market development but does not promote a ‘one size fits all’ approach examples of projects funded in this area include:
the economics of renewables and energy efficiency - the size the cost structure and the longer return of investment - make it necessary to develop special finance mechanisms particularly in emerging markets and developing countries reeep supports projects that create new sources of finance with local institutions as well as projects that develop ways to expand small projects to a bankable size leverage local capital markets reduce transaction costs and manage risk
examples of projects funded in this area include:
since its founding as an independent entity reeep has disbursed a total of €18.6 million of its own funds on 185 projects and attracted an additional €36.3 million in project co-funding
from 2003 to 2005 prior to reeep’s founding as an independent entity its first and second programme cycles funded 48 projects via the global opportunities fund gof of the uk foreign and commonwealth office fco under the reeep banner
the third programme cycle was the first to be independently managed by reeep a total of 18 projects were selected for funding during the year 2005-6 reeep operates on a financial year that runs from 1 april to 30 march in 2006-7 the fourth and fifth programme cycles saw a shift in funding from renewable energy to energy efficiency and a focus on africa 28 projects reached the implementation stage
the sixth programme cycle funded 35 projects in july 2007 and the seventh cycle followed in may 2009 funding a further 48 in june 2011 reeep announced the funding of 25 projects in its 8th programme cycle targeting brazil china india indonesia south africa and selected sub-saharan african countries
in addition to reeep-funded projects during autumn 2011 reeep issued a joint call for proposals with the opec fund for international development ofid specifically targeting energy access in least developed countries in february 2012 the funding of three rural energy access projects in cambodia ethiopia and tanzania was announced
on 9 january 2013 reeep announced that it will fund 28 new projects in its 9th funding cycle these were selected from 98 final proposals and cover five thematic areas: scaling up successful business models supporting off-grid generation harnessing the benefits of clean energy in both food production and in reliable water supply and opening up energy data in emerging markets
reegle with a lower-case r is a clean energy information portal designed to provide easy access to highly reliable information on renewable energy and energy efficiency the website draws information from eight different open data sources such as the world bank undata openei the cia factbook and the reeep sustainable energy regulation network publications to provide understanding of energy issues
the portal has four main components:
reegle was developed by reeep in collaboration with ren21 and was funded by the governments of germany netherlands united kingdom as of march 2012 the website attracted an average of 220,000 users per month during 2011 59% of its users came from africa and asia underlining the site’s character as an information resource for developing countries and emerging markets
reegle is an advocate of the linked open data movement which seeks to make public data available on the web in open formats that are machine-readable
the reegle tagging api is a cost-free tagging tool for those publishing online resources in the clean energy and climate sectors it automatically scans and tags online documents consistently and can also be used to suggest related documents from all items already indexed using the tool
to assist in activating stakeholders reeep supports several major strategic initiatives
in line with the emphasis on policy and regulation reeep also supports the renewable energy and international law reil provides a forum for senior level legal and technical experts to gather for discussions and commissions studies that provide analyses of the barriers and opportunities in international law reil has ongoing commissioned work on marine issues climate change biodiversity waste investment and trade law grid connection and tradable renewable energy certificates green certificates
to facilitate sharing amongst regulators on policy and regulatory mechanisms reeep supports the sustainable energy regulators network sern which comprises regulatory bodies government departments energy companies ngos and researchers
sern publishes a policy and regulatory review outlining regulatory institutions and mechanisms relevant to re and ee for more than 168 countries a best practice policy compendium on renewable energy and energy efficiency has been developed to share us state and local level practices with emerging markets in cooperation with the united nations industrial development organization unido sern has also developed training courses and seminars for regulators
the energy efficiency coalition eec is a network of stakeholders established by reeep to help draw together initiatives in the energy efficiency field and to promote real action on the ground its priority area of focus is on buildings which account for 40% of world energy use according to the wbcsd energy efficiency in buildings project
in spring 2009 the eec brought together the major energy efficiency stakeholders in mexico to sign a joint mou committing the organisations to the development of a joint action plan to implement energy efficiency in buildings at state and municipal level across mexico the signatories include the national commission for energy efficiency conuee the national network of state energy commission renace and the association for energy efficiency in buildings aeaee this approach could form a model for other countries such as brazil in promoting energy efficiency in buildings
currently reeep has 385 partners 45 of which are governments including all the g7 countries and key government agencies from india and china other emerging markets and the developing world partners also inclu

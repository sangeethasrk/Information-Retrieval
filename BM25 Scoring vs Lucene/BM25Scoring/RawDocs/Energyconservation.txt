energy conservation - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
energy conservation refers to reducing energy consumption through using less of an energy service energy conservation differs from efficient energy use which refers to using less energy for a constant service for example driving less is an example of energy conservation driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle is an example of energy efficiency energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques
even though energy conservation reduces energy services it can result in increased environmental quality national security personal financial security and higher savings it is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy it also lowers energy costs by preventing future resource depletion


some countries employ energy or carbon taxes to motivate energy users to reduce their consumption carbon taxes can allow consumption to shift to nuclear power and other alternatives that carry a different set of environmental side effects and limitations meanwhile taxes on all energy consumption stand to reduce energy use across the board while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production the state of california employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax as usage increases above that baseline the tax is increasing drastically such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers
one of the primary ways to improve energy conservation in buildings is to use an energy audit an energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the outputs this is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above in addition recent development of smartphone apps enable homeowners to complete relativily sophisticated energy audits themselves
building technologies and smart meters can allow energy users business and residential to see graphically the impact their energy use can have in their workplace or homes advanced real-time energy metering is able to help people save energy by their actions
in passive solar building design windows walls and floors are made to collect store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer this is called passive solar design or climatic design because unlike active solar heating systems it doesn't involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices
the key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type thermal insulation thermal mass and shading passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings but existing buildings can be retrofitted
in the united states suburban infrastructure evolved during an age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels which has led to transportation-dependent systems of living zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation the use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy as many americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day
consumers are often poorly informed of the savings of energy efficient products a prominent example of this is the energy savings that can be made by replacing an incandescent light bulb with a more modern alternative when purchasing light bulbs many consumers opt for cheap incandescent bulbs failing to take into account their higher energy costs and lower lifespans when compared to modern compact fluorescent and led bulbs although these energy-efficient alternatives have a higher upfront cost their long lifespan and low energy use can save consumers a considerable amount of money the price of leds has also been steadily decreasing in the past five years due to improvement of the semiconductor technology many led bulbs on the market qualify for utility rebates that further reduce the price of purchase to the consumer estimates by the us department of energy state that widespread adoption of led lighting over the next 20 years could result in about $265 billion worth of savings in united states energy costs
the research one must put into conserving energy is often too time consuming and costly for the average consumer when there are cheaper products and technology available using today's fossil fuels some governments and ngos are attempting to reduce this complexity with ecolabels that make differences in energy efficiency easy to research while shopping
to provide the kind of information and support people need to invest money time and effort in energy conservation it is important to understand and link to people's topical concerns for instance some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing however health studies have demonstrated that headache stress blood pressure fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings it has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers while reducing energy consumption
in warm climates where air conditioning is used any household device that gives off heat will result in a larger load on the cooling system items such as stove dish washer clothes dryer hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the air conditioning to remove the air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water
in cold climates heating air and water is a major demand on household energy use by investing in newer technologies in the home significant energy reductions are possible heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to using electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water a variety of efficient clothes dryers are available and the classic clothes line requires no energy only time natural gas condensing boilers and hot air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot flue models new construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from waste water or exhaust air in bathrooms laundry and kitchens
in both warm and cold climate extremes airtight thermal insulated construction will largely determine the efficiency of a home insulation is added to minimize the flow of heat to or from the home but can be labor-intensive to retrofit to an existing home
at the end of 2006 the european union eu pledged to cut its annual consumption of primary energy by 20% by 2020 the 'european union energy efficiency action plan' is long awaited directive 2012 27 eu is on energy efficiency
as part of the eu's save programme aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behaviour the boiler efficiency directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels
petroleum conservation research association pcra is an indian government body created in 1977 and engaged in promoting energy efficiency and conservation in every walk of life in the recent past pcra has done mass media campaigns in television radio & print media an impact assessment survey by a third party revealed that due to these mega campaigns by pcra overall awareness level have gone up leading to saving of fossil fuels worth crores of rupeesindian currency besides reducing pollution
bureau of energy efficiency is an indian governmental organization created in 2001 responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation
in iran the iranian fuel conservation company is responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation for fossil fuels the administration decreased the fuel subsidies primarily to reduce the effect of ra

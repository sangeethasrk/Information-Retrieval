water purification - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
water purification is the process of removing undesirable chemicals biological contaminants suspended solids and gases from contaminated water the goal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose most water is disinfected for human consumption drinking water but water purification may also be designed for a variety of other purposes including fulfilling the requirements of medical pharmacological chemical and industrial applications the methods used include physical processes such as filtration sedimentation and distillation biological processes such as slow sand filters or biologically active carbon chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light
purifying water may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including suspended particles parasites bacteria algae viruses fungi as well as reducing the amount of a range of dissolved and particulate material derived from the surfaces that come from runoff due to rain
the standards for drinking water quality are typically set by governments or by international standards these standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants depending on the intended purpose of water use
visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality simple procedures such as boiling or the use of a household activated carbon filter are not sufficient for treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source even natural spring water – considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century – must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment if any is needed chemical and microbiological analysis while expensive are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification
according to a 2007 world health organization who report 1.1 billion people lack access to an improved drinking water supply 88 percent of the 4 billion annual cases of diarrheal disease are attributed to unsafe water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene while 1.8 million people die from diarrheal diseases each year the who estimates that 94 percent of these diarrheal cases are preventable through modifications to the environment including access to safe water simple techniques for treating water at home such as chlorination filters and solar disinfection and storing it in safe containers could save a huge number of lives each year reducing deaths from waterborne diseases is a major public health goal in developing countries
the aims of the treatment are to remove unwanted constituents in the water and to make it safe to drink or fit for a specific purpose in industry or medical applications widely varied techniques are available to remove contaminants like fine solids micro-organisms and some dissolved inorganic and organic materials or environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants the choice of method will depend on the quality of the water being treated the cost of the treatment process and the quality standards expected of the processed water
the processes below are the ones commonly used in water purification plants some or most may not be used depending on the scale of the plant and quality of the raw source water
pure water has a ph close to 7 neither alkaline nor acidic sea water can have ph values that range from 7.5 to 8.4 moderately alkaline fresh water can have widely ranging ph values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer and the influence of contaminant inputs acid rain if the water is acidic lower than 7 lime soda ash or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the ph during water purification processes lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration thus raising the water hardness for highly acidic waters forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the ph by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes acid carbonic acid hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the ph alkaline water above ph 7.0 does not necessarily mean that lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water the ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of ph mineral content temperature alkalinity and calcium concentration
one of the first steps in a conventional water purification process is the addition of chemicals to assist in the removal of particles suspended in water particles can be inorganic such as clay and silt or organic such as algae bacteria viruses protozoa and natural organic matter inorganic and organic particles contribute to the turbidity and color of water
the addition of inorganic coagulants such as aluminum sulfate or alum or iron iii salts such as ironiii chloride cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on and among the particles within seconds negative charges on the particles are neutralized by inorganic coagulants also within seconds metal hydroxide precipitates of the aluminum and iron iii ions begin to form these precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as brownian motion and through induced mixing which is sometimes referred to as flocculation the term most often used for the amorphous metal hydroxides is floc large amorphous aluminum and iron iii hydroxides adsorb and enmesh particles in suspension and facilitate the removal of particles by subsequent processes of sedimentation and filtration
aluminum hydroxides are formed within a fairly narrow ph range typically: 5.5 to about 7.7 iron iii hydroxides can form over a larger ph range including ph levels lower than are effective for alum typically: 5.0 to 8.5
in the literature there is much debate and confusion over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculation—where does coagulation end and flocculation begin in water purification plants there is usually a high energy rapid mix unit process detention time in seconds where the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc in fact coagulation and flocculation processes are ongoing once the metal salt coagulants are added
organic polymers were developed in the 1960s as aids to coagulants and in some cases as replacements for the inorganic metal salt coagulants synthetic organic polymers are high molecular weight compounds that carry negative positive or neutral charges when organic polymers are added to water with particulates the high molecular weight compounds adsorb onto particle surfaces and through interparticle bridging coalesce with other particles to form floc polydadmac is a popular cationic positively charged organic polymer used in water purification plants
waters exiting the flocculation basin may enter the sedimentation basin also called a clarifier or settling basin it is a large tank with low water velocities allowing floc to settle to the bottom the sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up sedimentation basins may be rectangular where water flows from end to end or circular where flow is from the centre outward sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits
in 1904 allen hazen showed that the efficiency of a sedimentation process was a function of the particle settling velocity the flow through the tank and the surface area of tank sedimentation tanks are typically designed within a range of overflow rates of 0.5 to 1.0 gallons per minute per square foot or 1.25 to 2.5 meters per hour in general sedimentation basin efficiency is not a function of detention time or depth of the basin although basin depth must be sufficient so that water currents do not disturb the sludge and settled particle interactions are promoted as particle concentrations in the settled water increase near the sludge surface on the bottom of the tank settling velocities can increase due to collisions and agglomeration of particles typical detention times for sedimentation vary from 1.5 to 4 hours and basin depths vary from 10 to 15 feet 3 to 4.5 meters
inclined flat plates or tubes can be added to traditional sedimentation basins to improve particle removal performance inclined plates and tubes drastically increase the surface area available for particles to be removed in concert with hazen's original theory the amount of ground surface area occupied by a sedimentation basin with inclined plates or tubes can be far smaller than a conventional sedimentation basin
as particles settle to the bottom of a sedimentation basin a layer of sludge is formed on the floor of the tank which must be removed and treated the amount of sludge generated is significant often 3 to 5 percent of the total volume of water to be treated the cost of treating and disposing of the sludge can impact the operating cost of a water treatment plant the sedimentation basin may be equipped with mechanical cleaning devices that continually clean its bottom or the basin can be periodically taken out of service and cleaned manually
a subcategory of sedimentation is the removal of particulates by entrapment in a layer of suspended floc as the water is forced upward the major advantage of floc blanket clarifiers is that they occupy a smaller footprint than conventional sedimentation disadvantages are that particle removal efficiency can be highly variable depending on changes in influent water quality and influent water flow rate
when particles to be removed do not settle out of solution easily dissolved air flotation daf is often used water supplies that are particularly vulnerable to unicellular algae blooms and supplies with low turbidity and high colour often employ daf after coagulation and flocculation processes water flows to daf tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc the floating floc blanket is removed from the surface and clarified water is withdrawn from the bottom of the daf tank
after separating most floc the water is filtered as the final step to remove remaining suspended particles and unsettled floc
the most common type of filter is a rapid sand filter water moves vertically through sand which often has a layer of activated carbon or anthracite coal above the sand the top layer removes organic compounds which contribute to taste and odour the space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles so simple filtration is not enough most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter this property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles the filter would quickly clog
to clean the filter water is passed quickly upward through the filter opposite the normal direction called backflushing or backwashing to remove embedded particles prior to this step compressed air may be blown up through the bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process this is known as air scouring this contaminated water can be disposed of along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water
some water treatment plants employ pressure filters these work on the same principle as rapid gravity filters differing in that the filter medium is enclosed in a steel vessel and the water is forced through it under pressure
advantages:
slow sand filters may be used where there is sufficient land and space as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters these filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration the filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand with the coarsest sand along with some gravel at the bottom and finest sand at the top drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer called the zoogleal layer or schmutzdecke on the surface of the filter an effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pre-treatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products slow sand filters are not backwashed they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth
a specific large-scale form of slow sand filter is the process of bank filtration in which natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide a first stage of contaminant filtration while typically not clean enough to be used directly for drinking water the water gained from the associated extraction wells is much less problematic than river water taken directly from the major streams where bank filtration is often used
membrane filters are widely used for filtering both drinking water and sewage for drinking water membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2 μm—including giardia and cryptosporidium membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry for limited domestic purposes or before discharging the water into a river that is used by towns further downstream they are widely used in industry particularly for beverage preparation including bottled water however no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as phosphorus nitrates and heavy metal ions
ultrafiltration membranes use polymer membranes with chemically formed microscopic pores that can be used to filter out dissolved substances avoiding the use of coagulants the type of membrane media determines how much pressure is needed to drive the water through and what sizes of micro-organisms can be filtered out
ion exchange: ion exchange systems use ion exchange resin- or zeolite-packed columns to replace unwanted ions the most common case is water softening consisting of removal of ca and mg ions replacing them with benign soap friendly na or k ions ion exchange resins are also used to remove toxic ions such as nitrite lead mercury arsenic and many others
precipitative softening: water rich in hardness calcium and magnesium ions is treated with lime calcium oxide and or soda-ash sodium carbonate to precipitate calcium carbonate out of solution utilizing the common-ion effect
electrodeionization: water is passed between a positive electrode and a negative electrode ion exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode high purity deionized water is produced continuously similar to ion exchange treatment complete removal of ions from water is possible of the right conditions are met the water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove non-ionic organic contaminants and with gas transfer membranes to remove carbon dioxide a water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the ro inlet
disinfection is accomplished both by filtering out harmful micro-organisms and also by adding disinfectant chemicals water is disinfected to kill any pathogens which pass through the filters and to provide a residual dose of disinfectant to kill or inactivate potentially harmful micro-organisms in the storage and distribution systems possible pathogens include viruses bacteria including salmonella cholera campylobacter and shigella and protozoa including giardia lamblia and other cryptosporidia following the introduction of any chemical disinfecting agent the water is usually held in temporary storage – often called a contact tank or clear well to allow the disinfecting action to complete
the most common disinfection method involves some form of chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms because chlorine is a toxic gas there is a danger of a release associated with its use this problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions a solid form calcium hypochlorite releases chlorine on contact with water handling the solid however requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated the generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine
all forms of chlorine are widely used despite their respective drawbacks one drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by-products these by-products trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are both carcinogenic in large quantities and are regulated by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the drinking water inspectorate in the uk the formation of thms and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria it has limited effectiveness against protozoa that form cysts in water giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium both of which are pathogenic
chlorine dioxide is a faster-acting disinfectant than elemental chlorine it is relatively rarely used because in some circumstances it may create excessive amounts of chlorite which is a by-product regulated to low allowable levels in the united states chlorine dioxide can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems chlorine dioxide gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate
the use of chloramine is becoming more common as a disinfectant although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine and it will not readily form thms or haloacetic acids it is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding ammonia to the water after addition of chlorine the chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience nitrification as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth with nitrates being generated as a by-product
ozone is an unstable molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms it is a very strong broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in europe it is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts it also works well against almost all other pathogens ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a cold electrical discharge to use ozone as a disinfectant it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact some of the advantages of ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems in comparison to chlorination  another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in nice france the us food and drug administration has accepted ozone as being safe and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment storage and processing of foods however although fewer by-products are formed by ozonation it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen bromate bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce after ozonation more than 10 parts per billion ppb of bromate — the maximum contaminant level established by the usepa
ultraviolet light uv is very effective at inactivating cysts in low turbidity water uv light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases a result of the absorption scattering and shadowing caused by the suspended solids the main disadvantage to the use of uv radiation is that like ozone treatment it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water therefore it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process this is often done through the addition of chloramines discussed above as a primary disinfectant when used in this manner chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination
portable water purification devices and methods are available for disinfection and treatment in emergencies or in remote locations disinfection is the primary goal since aesthetic considerations such as taste odor appearance and trace chemical contamination do not affect the short-term safety of drinking water
other popular methods for purifying water especially for local private supplies are listed below in some countries some of these methods are also used for large scale municipal supplies particularly important are distillation de-salination of seawater and reverse osmosis
in april 2007 the water supply of spencer massachusetts became contaminated with excess sodium hydroxide lye when its treatment equipment malfunctioned
many municipalities have moved from free chlorine to chloramine as a disinfection agent however chloramine appears to be a corrosive agent in some water systems chloramine can dissolve the protective film inside older service lines leading to the leaching of lead into residential spigots this can result in harmful exposure including elevated blood lead levels lead is a known neurotoxin
distillation removes all minerals from water and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals this results in demineralized water which is not considered ideal drinking water the world health organization has investigated the health effects of demineralized water since 1980 experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes with decreased blood serum potassium concentration magnesium calcium and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10 mg l with 20–30 mg l optimum for calcium a 20 mg l minimum and a 40–80 mg l optimum and a total water hardness adding magnesium and calcium of 2 to 4 mmol l at water hardness above 5 mmol l higher incidence of gallstones kidney stones urinary stones arthrosis and arthropathies have been observed additionally desalination processes can increase the risk of bacterial contamination
manufacturers of home water distillers claim the opposite—that minerals in water are the cause of many diseases and that most beneficial minerals come from food not water they quote the american medical association as saying the body's need for minerals is largely met through foods

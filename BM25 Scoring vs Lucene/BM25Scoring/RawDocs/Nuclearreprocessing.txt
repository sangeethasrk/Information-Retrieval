nuclear reprocessing - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
nuclear reprocessing technology was developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel reprocessing serves multiple purposes whose relative importance has changed over time originally reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing nuclear weapons with the commercialization of nuclear power the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into mox nuclear fuel for thermal reactors the reprocessed uranium which constitutes the bulk of the spent fuel material can in principle also be re-used as fuel but that is only economic when uranium prices are high finally a breeder reactor is not restricted to using recycled plutonium and uranium it can employ all the actinides closing the nuclear fuel cycle and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from natural uranium by about 60 times
nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism the political challenges of repository siting a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle in the united states the obama administration stepped back from president bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in europe russia and japan


the potentially useful components dealt with in nuclear reprocessing comprise specific actinides plutonium uranium and some minor actinides the lighter elements components include fission products activation products and cladding
the first large-scale nuclear reactors were built during world war ii these reactors were designed for the production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons the only reprocessing required therefore was the extraction of the plutonium free of fission-product contamination from the spent natural uranium fuel in 1943 several methods were proposed for separating the relatively small quantity of plutonium from the uranium and fission products the first method selected a precipitation process called the bismuth phosphate process was developed and tested at the oak ridge national laboratory ornl between 1943 and 1945 to produce quantities of plutonium for evaluation and use in the us weapons programs ornl produced the first macroscopic quantities grams of separated plutonium with these processes
the bismuth phosphate process was first operated on a large scale at the hanford site in the later part of 1944 it was successful for plutonium separation in the emergency situation existing then but it had a significant weakness: the inability to recover uranium
the first successful solvent extraction process for the recovery of pure uranium and plutonium was developed at ornl in 1949 the purex process is the current method of extraction separation plants were also constructed at savannah river site and a smaller plant at west valley reprocessing plant which closed by 1972 because of its inability to meet new regulatory requirements
reprocessing of civilian fuel has long been employed at the cogema la hague site in france the sellafield site in the united kingdom the mayak chemical combine in russia and at sites such as the tokai plant in japan the tarapur plant in india and briefly at the west valley reprocessing plant in the united states
in october 1976 concern of nuclear weapons proliferation especially after india demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology led president gerald ford to issue a presidential directive to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the us on 7 april 1977 president jimmy carter banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor spent nuclear fuel the key issue driving this policy was the serious threat of nuclear weapons proliferation by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle and to encourage other nations to follow the usa lead after that only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued to reprocess spent nuclear fuel president reagan lifted the ban in 1981 but did not provide the substantial subsidy that would have been necessary to start up commercial reprocessing
in march 1999 the us department of energy doe reversed its policy and signed a contract with a consortium of duke energy cogema and stone & webster dcs to design and operate a mixed oxide mox fuel fabrication facility site preparation at the savannah river site south carolina began in october 2005 in 2011 the new york times reported 11 years after the government awarded a construction contract the cost of the project has soared to nearly $5 billion the vast concrete and steel structure is a half-finished hulk and the government has yet to find a single customer despite offers of lucrative subsidies tva currently the most likely customer said in april 2011 that it would delay a decision until it could see how mox fuel performed in the nuclear accident at fukushima daiichi
purex the current standard method is an acronym standing for plutonium and uranium recovery by extraction the purex process is a liquid-liquid extraction method used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to extract uranium and plutonium independent of each other from the fission products this is the most developed and widely used process in the industry at present when used on fuel from commercial power reactors the plutonium extracted typically contains too much pu-240 to be considered weapons-grade plutonium ideal for use in a nuclear weapon nevertheless highly reliable nuclear weapons can be built at all levels of technical sophistication using any kind of reactor-produced plutonium moreover reactors that are capable of refuelling frequently can be used to produce weapon-grade plutonium which can later be recovered using purex because of this purex chemicals are monitored
the purex process can be modified to make a urex uranium extraction process which could be used to save space inside high level nuclear waste disposal sites such as the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository by removing the uranium which makes up the vast majority of the mass and volume of used fuel and recycling it as reprocessed uranium
the urex process is a purex process which has been modified to prevent the plutonium from being extracted this can be done by adding a plutonium reductant before the first metal extraction step in the urex process ~99.9% of the uranium and >95% of technetium are separated from each other and the other fission products and actinides the key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid aha to the extraction and scrub sections of the process the addition of aha greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the purex process
adding a second extraction agent octylphenyl-n n-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxidecmpo in combination with tributylphosphate tbp the purex process can be turned into the truex transuranic extraction process truex was invented in the usa by argonne national laboratory and is designed to remove the transuranic metals am cm from waste the idea is that by lowering the alpha activity of the waste the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease in common with purex this process operates by a solvation mechanism
as an alternative to truex an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised the diamex diamideextraction process has the advantage of avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber the diamex process is being worked on in europe by the french cea the process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process in common with purex this process operates by a solvation mechanism
selective actinide extraction as part of the management of minor actinides it has been proposed that the lanthanides and trivalent minor actinides should be removed from the purex raffinate by a process such as diamex or truex in order to allow the actinides such as americium to be either reused in industrial sources or used as fuel the lanthanides must be removed the lanthanides have large neutron cross sections and hence they would poison a neutron driven nuclear reaction to date the extraction system for the sanex process has not been defined but currently several different research groups are working towards a process for instance the french cea is working on a bis-triazinyl pyridine btp based process other systems such as the dithiophosphinic acids are being worked on by some other workers
the universal extraction process was developed in russia and the czech republic it is designed to completely remove the most troublesome radioisotopes sr cs and minor actinides from the raffinate remaining after the extraction of uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel the chemistry is based upon the interaction of caesium and strontium with polyethylene glycol and a cobalt carborane anion known as chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide the actinides are extracted by cmpo and the diluent is a polar aromatic such as nitrobenzene other dilents such as meta-nitrobenzotrifluoride and phenyl trifluoromethyl sulfone have been suggested as well
an exotic method using electrochemistry and ion exchange in ammonium carbonate has been reported
the bismuth phosphate process is an obsolete process that adds significant unnecessary material to the final radioactive waste the bismuth phosphate process has been replaced by solvent extraction processes the bismuth phosphate process was designed to extract plutonium from aluminium-clad nuclear fuel rods containing uranium the fuel was decladded by boiling it in caustic soda after decladding the uranium metal was dissolved in nitric acid
the plutonium at this point is in the +4 oxidation state it was then precipitated out of the solution by the addition of bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid to form the bismuth phosphate the plutonium was coprecipitated with this the supernatant liquid containing many of the fission products was separated from the solid the precipitate was then dissolved in nitric acid before the addition of an oxidant such as potassium permanganate which converted the plutonium to puo2 pu vi then a dichromate salt was added to maintain the plutonium in the +6 oxidation state
the bismuth phosphate was next re-precipitated leaving the plutonium in solution then an iron ii salt such as ferrous sulfate was added and the plutonium re-precipitated again using a bismuth phosphate carrier precipitate then lanthanum salts and fluoride were added to create solid lanthanum fluoride which acted as a carrier for the plutonium this was converted to the oxide by the action of an alkali the lanthanum plutonium oxide was next collected and extracted with nitric acid to form plutonium nitrate
this is a liquid-liquid extraction process which uses methyl isobutyl ketone as the extractant the extraction is by a solvation mechanism this process has the disadvantage of requiring the use of a salting-out reagent aluminium nitrate to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio d value also hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid this process has been replaced by the purex process
pu + 4 no3 + 2s → puno34s2
a process based on a solvation extraction process using the triether extractant named above this process has the disadvantage of requiring the use of a salting-out reagent aluminium nitrate to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio this process was used at windscale many years ago this process has been replaced by purex
pyroprocessing is a generic term for high-temperature methods solvents are molten salts eg licl+kcl or lif+caf2 and molten metals eg cadmium bismuth magnesium rather than water and organic compounds electrorefining distillation and solvent-solvent extraction are common steps
these processes are not currently in significant use worldwide but they have been researched and developed at argonne national laboratory and elsewhere
advantages
disadvantages
these processes were developed by argonne national laboratory and used in the integral fast reactor project
pyro-a is a means of separating actinides elements within the actinide family generally heavier than u-235 from non-actinides the spent fuel is placed in an anode basket which is immersed in a molten salt electrolyte an electric current is applied causing the uranium metal or sometimes oxide depending on the spent fuel to plate out on a solid metal cathode while the other actinides and the rare earths can be absorbed into a liquid cadmium cathode many of the fission products such as caesium zirconium and strontium remain in the salt as alternatives to the molten cadmium electrode it is possible to use a molten bismuth cathode or a solid aluminium cathode
as an alternative to electrowinning the wanted metal can be isolated by using a molten alloy of an electropositive metal and a less reactive metal
since the majority of the long term radioactivity and volume of spent fuel comes from actinides removing the actinides produces waste that is more compact and not nearly as dangerous over the long term the radioactivity of this waste will then drop to the level of various naturally occurring minerals and ores within a few hundred rather than thousands of years
the mixed actinides produced by pyrometallic processing can be used again as nuclear fuel as they are virtually all either fissile or fertile though many of these materials would require a fast breeder reactor in order to be burned efficiently in a thermal neutron spectrum the concentrations of several heavy actinides curium-242 and plutonium-240 can become quite high creating fuel that is substantially different from the usual uranium or mixed uranium-plutonium oxides mox that most current reactors were designed to use
another pyrochemical process the pyro-b process has been developed for the processing and recycling of fuel from a transmuter reactor  a fast breeder reactor designed to convert transuranic nuclear waste into fission products  a typical transmuter fuel is free from uranium and contains recovered transuranics in an inert matrix such as metallic zirconium in the pyro-b processing of such fuel an electrorefining step is used to separate the residual transuranic elements from the fission products and recycle the transuranics to the reactor for fissioning newly generated technetium and iodine are extracted for incorporation into transmutation targets and the other fission products are sent to waste
voloxidation for volumetric oxidation involves heating oxide fuel with oxygen sometimes with alternating oxidation and reduction or alternating oxidation by ozone to uranium trioxide with decomposition by heating back to triuranium octoxide a major purpose is to capture tritium as tritiated water vapor before further processing where it would be difficult to retain the tritium other volatile elements leave the fuel and must be recovered especially iodine technetium and carbon-14 voloxidation also breaks up the fuel or increases its surface area to enhance penetration of reagents in following reprocessing steps
simply heating spent oxide fuel in an inert atmosphere or vacuum at a temperature between 700 °c and 1000 °c as a first reprocessing step can remove several volatile elements including caesium whose isotope caesium-137 emits about half of the heat produced by the spent fuel over the following 100 years of cooling however most of the other half is from strontium-90 which remains the estimated overall mass balance for

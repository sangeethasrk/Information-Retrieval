although the european union has legislated in the area of energy policy for many years the concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive european union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the informal european council on 27 october 2005 at hampton court the eu treaty of lisbon of 2007 legally includes solidarity in matters of energy supply and changes to the energy policy within the eu prior to the treaty of lisbon eu energy legislation has been based on the eu authority in the area of the common market and environment however in practice many policy competencies in relation to energy remain at national member state level and progress in policy at european level requires voluntary cooperation by members states
in 2007 the eu was importing 82% of its oil and 57% of its gas which then made it the world's leading importer of these fuels only 3% of the uranium used in european nuclear reactors was mined in europe russia canada australia niger and kazakhstan were the five largest suppliers of nuclear materials to the eu supplying more than 75% of the total needs in 2009 in 2015 the eu imports 53% of the energy it consumes in january 2014 the eu agreed to a 40% emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and a 27% renewable energy target the target is the most ambitious of any region in the world and is expected to provide 70,000 full-time jobs and cut €33bn in fossil fuel imports
in 2015 the framework strategy for energy union is launched as one of the european commission's 10 priorities


the energy union strategy is a project of the european commission to coordinate the transformation of european energy supply it was launched in february 2015 with the aim of providing secure sustainable competitive affordable energy
donald tusk president of the european council introduced the idea of an energy union when he was prime minister of poland eurocommissioner vice president maroš šefčovič called the energy union the biggest energy project since the european coal and steel community the eu's reliance on russia for its energy and the annexation of crimea by russia have been cited as strong reasons for the importance of this policy
the european council concluded on march 19 2015 that the eu is committed to building an energy union with a forward-looking climate policy on the basis of the commission's framework strategy with five priority dimensions:

the strategy includes a minimum 10% electricity interconnection target for all member states by 2020 which the commission hopes will put downward pressure energy prices reduce the need to build new power plants reduce the risk of black-outs improve the reliability of renewable energy supplies and encourage market integration
the possible principles of energy policy for europe were elaborated at the commission's green paper a european strategy for sustainable competitive and secure energy on 8 march 2006 as a result of the decision to develop a common energy policy the first proposals energy for a changing world were published by the european commission following a consultation process on 10 january 2007
it is claimed that they will lead to a 'post-industrial revolution' or a low-carbon economy in the european union as well as increased competition in the energy markets improved security of supply and improved employment prospects the commission's proposals have been approved at a meeting of the european council on 8 and 9 march 2007
key proposals include:
underlying many of the proposals are to designed to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2 °c above pre-industrial levels of which 0.8 °c has already taken place and another 0.5–0.7 °c is already committed 2 °c is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid 'dangerous global warming' due to only minor efforts in global climate change mitigation it is highly likely that the world will not be able to reach this particular target the eu might then not only be forced to accept a less ambitious global target because the planned emissions reductions in the european energy sector 95% by 2050 are derived directly from the 2 °c target since 2007 the eu will have to revise its energy policy paradigm
in 2014 negotiations about binding eu energy and climate targets until 2030 are set to start european parliament voted in february 2014 in favour of binding 2030 targets on renewables emissions and energy efficiency: a 40% cut in greenhouse gases compared with 1990 levels at least 30% of energy to come from renewable sources and a 40% improvement in energy efficiency
the fp7 research program only reserved a moderate amount of funding for energy research although energy has recently emerged as one of the key issues of the european union a large part of fp7 energy funding is also devoted to fusion research a technology that will not be able to help meet european climate and energy objectives until beyond 2050 the european commission tried to redress this shortfall with the set plan
the steering group on the implementation of the strategic energy technologies plan set plan on 26 june 2008 will set the agenda for an eu energy technology policy it will enhance the coordination of national and european research and innovation efforts to position the eu in the forefront of the low-carbon technologies markets
the set plan initiatives:
the budget for the set plan is estimated at €71 billion
the iea raised its concern that demand-side technologies do not feature at all in the six priority areas of the set plan
the eu resolution is available in eur-lex
the european energy research alliance eera is founded by the leading research institutes in the european union eu to expand and optimise eu energy research capabilities through the sharing of world-class national facilities and the joint realisation of national and european programmes this new research alliance will be a key actor of the eu strategic energy technology plan set plan and will contribute to accelerate the development of new low carbon technologies for eu to move toward a low carbon economy
the climate and energy policy is a choice between democracy and autocracy the choice is one between patronage-based oil-and-gas oligarchies on the one hand and adaptive and innovative low-carbon economy on the other
under the requirements of the directive on electricity production from renewable energy sources which entered into force in october 2001 the member states are expected to meet indicative targets for renewable energy production although there is significant variation in national targets the average is that 22% of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2010 compared to 13,9% in 1997 the european commission has proposed in its renewable energy roadmap21 a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the eu's overall mix from less than 7% today to 20% by 2020
europe spent on importing fossil fuels €406 billion in 2011 bn and €545 bn in 2012 this is around three times more than the cost of the greek bailout up to 2013 in 2012 wind energy avoided €9.6 billion bn of fossil fuel costs ewea recommends binding renewable energy target to support in replacing fossil fuels with wind energy in europe by providing a stable regulatory framework in addition it recommends set a minimum emission performance standard for all new-build power installations
the eu promotes electricity market liberalisation and security of supply through directive 2009 72 ec
the 2004 gas security directive has been intended to improve security of supply in the natural gas sector
at the heiligendamm summit in june 2007 the g8 acknowledged an eu proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency tabled in march 2007 and agreed to explore together with the international energy agency the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally a year later on 8 june 2008 the g8 countries ch

fossil fuel - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms the age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years and sometimes exceeds 650 million years fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include coal petroleum and natural gas other more commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane they range from volatile materials with low carbon:hydrogen ratios like methane to liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon like anthracite coal methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields alone associated with oil or in the form of methane clathrates the theory that fossil fuels formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth's crust over millions of years see biogenic theory was first introduced by georgius agricola in 1556 and later by mikhail lomonosov in the 18th century
the energy information administration estimates that in 2007 the primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0% coal 27.4% natural gas 23.0% amounting to an 86.4% share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world non-fossil sources in 2006 included hydroelectric 6.3% nuclear 8.5% and others geothermal solar tidal wind wood waste amounting to 0.9% world energy consumption was growing about 2.3% per year
although fossil fuels are continually being formed via natural processes they are generally considered to be non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made
the use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns the burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes 21.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide co2 per year but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44 12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that enhances radiative forcing and contributes to global warming causing the average surface temperature of the earth to rise in response which the vast majority of climate scientists agree will cause major adverse effects a global movement towards the generation of renewable energy is therefore under way to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions


petroleum and natural gas are formed by the anaerobic decomposition of remains of organisms including phytoplankton and zooplankton that settled to the sea or lake bottom in large quantities under anoxic conditions millions of years ago over geological time this organic matter mixed with mud got buried under heavy layers of sediment the resulting high levels of heat and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter first into a waxy material known as kerogen which is found in oil shales and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis
there is a wide range of organic or hydrocarbon compounds in any given fuel mixture the specific mixture of hydrocarbons gives a fuel its characteristic properties such as boiling point melting point density viscosity etc some fuels like natural gas for instance contain only very low boiling gaseous components others such as gasoline or diesel contain much higher boiling components
terrestrial plants on the other hand tend to form coal and methane many of the coal fields date to the carboniferous period of earth's history terrestrial plants also form type iii kerogen a source of natural gas
fossil fuels are of great importance because they can be burned oxidized to carbon dioxide and water producing significant amounts of energy per unit weight the use of coal as a fuel predates recorded history coal was used to run furnaces for the melting of metal ore semi-solid hydrocarbons from seeps were also burned in ancient times but these materials were mostly used for waterproofing and embalming
commercial exploitation of petroleum largely as a replacement for oils from animal sources notably whale oil for use in oil lamps began in the 19th century
natural gas once flared-off as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production is now considered a very valuable resource natural gas deposits are also the main source of the element helium
heavy crude oil which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil and tar sands where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds which yield synthetic crude oil when heated pyrolyzed these materials have yet to be exploited commercially these fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines fossil fuel power stations and other uses
prior to the latter half of the 18th century windmills and watermills provided the energy needed for industry such as milling flour sawing wood or pumping water and burning wood or peat provided domestic heat the widescale use of fossil fuels coal at first and petroleum later to fire steam engines enabled the industrial revolution at the same time gas lights using natural gas or coal gas were coming into wide use the invention of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles and trucks greatly increased the demand for gasoline and diesel oil both made from fossil fuels other forms of transportation railways and aircraft also required fossil fuels the other major use for fossil fuels is in generating electricity and as feedstock for the petrochemical industry tar a leftover of petroleum extraction is used in construction of roads
levels of primary energy sources are the reserves in the ground flows are production of fossil fuels from these reserves the most important part of primary energy sources are the carbon based fossil energy sources coal oil and natural gas provided 79.6% of primary energy production during 2002 in million tonnes of oil equivalent mtoe 34.9+23.5+21.2
levels proved reserves during 2005–2006

p e hodgson a senior research fellow emeritus in physics at corpus christi college oxford expects the world energy use is doubling every fourteen years and the need is increasing faster still and he insisted in 2008 that the world oil production a main resource of fossil fuel is expected to peak in ten years and thereafter fall
the principle of supply and demand holds that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish prices will rise therefore higher prices will lead to increased alternative renewable energy supplies as previously uneconomic sources become sufficiently economical to exploit artificial gasolines and other renewable energy sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum reserves but may become economically viable in the near future different alternative sources of energy include nuclear hydroelectric solar wind and geothermal
one of the more promising energy alternatives is the use of inedible feed stocks and biomass for carbon dioxide capture as well as biofuel while these processes are not without problems they are currently in practice around the world biodiesels are being produced by several companies and source of great research at several universities some of the most common and promising processes of conversion of renewable lipids in to usable fuels is through hydrotreating and decarboxylation
the us holds less than 5% of the world's population but due to large houses and private cars uses more than a quarter of the world's supply of fossil fuels in the united states more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the combustion of fossil fuels combustion of fossil fuels also produces other air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide volatile organic compounds and heavy metals

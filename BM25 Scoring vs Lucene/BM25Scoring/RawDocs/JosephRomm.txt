romm served as acting assistant secretary of the us department of energy in charge of the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy during 1997 and as principal deputy assistant secretary from august 1995 through june 1998 and special assistant for policy and planning from 1993 to july 1995 this office with an annual budget at the time of $1 billion and 550 employees assists businesses in the industrial utility transportation and buildings sectors to develop and use advanced clean energy technologies to cut costs increase reliability and reduce pollution
as principal deputy assistant secretary romm was in charge of all policy and technology analysis and programmatic development for the office which was then developing pem fuel cells microturbines advanced cogeneration superconductivity building controls photovoltaics and other renewables biofuels and hydrogen production and storage among other projects he initiated supervised and publicized a comprehensive technical analysis in 1997 by five national laboratories of how energy technologies can best reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively entitled scenarios of us carbon reductions
after leaving the department of energy romm was the executive director and founder of the non-profit center for energy and climate solutions an organization based in the washington dc area that helped businesses and us states adopt high-leverage strategies for saving energy and cutting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions he was also a principal of the capital e group which consulted on technology assessment and sustainable design services for clean energy technologies and sat on the advisory board of securing america's future energy while at capital e group romm was also a registered lobbyist representing the interests of clients ion america and sunpower corp
during these years romm wrote widely on global warming and energy technologies that can reduce global warming his 2004 book the hype about hydrogen argues that putting off the implementation of current green technologies in favor of waiting for technological breakthroughs in hydrogen cars is a dangerous distraction that will delay urgently needed government action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions the book was named one of the best science and technology books of 2004 by library journal in reviewing the book daniel i sperling a member of arnold schwarzenegger's california air resources board offered dissenting views in 2004 romm also wrote the national commission on energy policy's report the car and fuel of the future which was rated the #1 hottest article on energy policy by sciencedirect he was also the principal investigator for the national science foundation project future directions for hydrogen energy research and education 2004 romm is interviewed in the 2006 documentary film who killed the electric car directed by chris paine and narrated by martin sheen in the film romm gives a presentation intended to show that the government's hydrogen car initiative was a bad policy choice and a distraction that was delaying the exploitation of more promising technologies such as electric and hybrid cars that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase america's energy security as of 2010 romm continued to view hydrogen as a breakthrough technology illusion
romm's 2006 book hell and high water projects that humans have a window of opportunity of only about a decade to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming it calls upon americans to demand government action to encourage and require the use of current emission-cutting technologies tyler hamilton in his review of the book for the toronto star wrote: whereas the first third of romm's book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the us public is being misled by a federal government backed by conservative political forces that is intent on inaction and that's also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions technology review wrote that hell and high water provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change a sensible agenda for technology and policy and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science
since late 2006 romm has been a senior fellow at the center for american progress founding their climate blog climate progress which focuses on climate science policy and reporting in 2008 time magazine named his blog one of the top 15 green websites writing that it counters bad science and inane rhetoric with original analysis delivered sharply  romm occupies the intersection of climate science economics and policy resist temptation to lump him in with knee-jerk enviros on his blog and in his december 2006 book hell and high water you can find some of the most cogent memorable and deployable arguments for immediate and overwhelming action to confront global warming in 2010 time magazine wrote viewing climate change through the prism of national security romm analyzes breaking energy news and the relevant research but most important he challenges the beliefs and conclusions of the mainstream media on climate-change issues as of 2016 romm continues to contribute to the site romm also writes for other top internet energy and news sites including the huffington post grist slate cnn and saloncom his july 2012 new york times opinion piece was called without carbon controls we face a dust bowl
romm has testified numerous times before congressional committees on energy and global warming issues offering his views on government action to curb global warming for example in july 2012 he testified before a natural resources subcommittee of the us house of representatives on the 2012 us drought and wildfires in march of the same year he testified before the house energy & commerce committee on the the american energy initiative and rising gasoline prices in 2010 he testified before the house ways and means committee on how to optimize energy tax incentives driving the green job economy and in 2007 he testified before the house committee on science and technology on the subject of fuels for the future specifically the use of liquid fuel from coal which he believes would accelerate global warming he also lectures on energy technology global warming and how the media portrays climate change
romm's 2010 book straight up is largely a selection of his best blog postings over the past few years related to climate change issues treehugger describes the book as a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change the media that so badly neglects it the politicians who attempt to address it and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore the science and the clean energy solutions that could help get us out of the mess in 2011 romm sat on the panel of the green car summit of the washington auto show his 2012 book language intelligence concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric ed markey commented on the book joe masterfully  scripts ways to master the metaphor and incorporate irony solutions the reader can use for speeches social media or just winning the debate around the kitchen table romm wrote an article for time magazine in august 2012 using the research from language intelligence to analyze whether mitt romney or barack obama is the more effective communicator in speeches and lectures since then romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book instead of their usual technical neutral style to better explain the dangers of and solutions to climate change to lay people and the media
romm is the chief science editor for the documentary tv series years of living dangerously about the impact of and solutions to climate change the first season of the series ran in 2014 on the showtime network he wrote climate change 101: an introduction for the series' website a second season is scheduled to run in 2016 on the national geographic channel the first season won the 2014 emmy award for outstanding documentary or nonfiction series in 2015 the weather channel included romm as one of the world's 25 most compelling voices on climate in its series the climate 25 that year romm also wrote the book climate change: what everyone needs to know a primer on the topic in q&a format
romm is often cited quoted or interviewed by journalists to explain the impact of public policy and energy technologies and applications on global warming and energy security or to explain causes and impacts of climate change or the influence of the media for example in 2009 msnbc relied on him to assess natural gas hydrates and he was featured on 60 minutes discussing the scientific evidence that clean coal is not clean in 2010 msnbc's countdown with keith olbermann program interviewed romm on how the military is taking action on climate change to improve national security guernica magazine interviewed him on the science and politics of global warming the new yorker asked him to comment on the koch-funded exhibit on evolution and climate change at a smithsonian museum and the atlantic and cbs news each reviewed a media call by romm concerning the relationship between the january 2010 snowstorms in washington dc and global warming
in 2011 the washington post linked with approval to romm's review of the scientific literature on climate change time magazine explored romm's critique of matthew nisbet and praised his analysis of the decline of media coverage regarding climate change national geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public the same year technology review quoted romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies and the toronto star quoted him regarding president obama's 2011 state of the union address in 2012 in the new york times economist paul krugman cited romm on the connection between drought and climate change and the atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the democrats to discuss climate change national geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear and current tv's bill press interviewed romm about record-breaking heat
in 2014 businessweek quoted romm regarding the lack of commercial viability of hydrogen fuel cells for cars and the guardian quoted him concerning international cooperation on climate change in 2015 the guardian quoted romm about historic high global temperatures and marketwatch quoted him on actions that donald trump might take concerning climate agreements if he were to be elected president later that year bulletin of the atomic scientists interviewed him about nuclear power and climate change
the new york times dot earth column reviewed romm's views on global warming solutions on november 24 2008 including his belief that to combat global warming humans cannot wait for new technologies and scientific breakthroughs that instead we must deploy existing and near-term low-carbon technologies as fast as is humanly possible in his blog romm has described the technology solutions that he believes can control global warming the new york times also quoted romm as stating that to solve the climate crisis we will need a wwii-style approach the article noted romm's belief that credible people and the press should publicly support the notion that government action is needed to help solve the global warming crisis in particular the press should explain how current news stories such as hurricanes droughts and insect infestations are related to global warming
according to us news & world report romm believes that glo

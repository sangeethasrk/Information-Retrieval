low-carbon power - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
low-carbon power comes from processes or technologies that produce power with substantially lower amounts of carbon dioxide emissions than is emitted from conventional fossil fuel power generation it includes low carbon power generation sources such as wind power solar power hydropower and including fuel preparation and decommissioning nuclear power the term largely excludes conventional fossil fuel plant sources and is only used to describe a particular subset of operating fossil fuel power systems specifically those that are successfully coupled with a flue gas carbon capture and storage ccs system


over the past 30 years significant findings regarding global warming highlighted the need to curb carbon emissions from this the idea for low carbon power was born the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc established by the world meteorological organization wmo and the united nations environment program unep in 1988 set the scientific precedence for the introduction of low carbon power the ipcc has continued to provide scientific technical and socio-economic advice to the world community through its periodic assessment reports and special reports
internationally the most prominent early step in the direction of low carbon power was the signing of the kyoto protocol which came into force on february 16 2005 under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions the historical event set the political precedence for introduction of low carbon power technology
on a social level perhaps the biggest factor contributing to the general public’s awareness of climate change and the need for new technologies including low carbon power came from the documentary an inconvenient truth which clarified and highlighted the problem of global warming
the swedish utility vattenfall did a study of full life cycle emissions of nuclear hydro coal gas solar cell peat and wind which the utility uses to produce electricity the net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per kw-hr of produced power this compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal according to this study the study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of co2 of any of their electricity sources
a 2008 meta analysis valuing the use gas emissions from nuclear power: a critical survey by benjamin k sovacool analysed 103 life cycle studies of greenhouse gas-equivalent emissions for nuclear power plants the studies surveyed included the 1997 vattenfall comparative emissions study among others sovacool's analysis calculated that the mean value of emissions over the lifetime of a nuclear power plant is 66 g kwh comparative results for wind power hydroelectricity solar thermal power and solar photovoltaic were 9-10 g kwh 10-13 g kwh 13 g kwh and 32 g kwh respectively sovacool's analysis has been criticized for poor methodology and data selection
a 2012 life cycle assessment lca review by yale university said that depending on conditions median life cycle ghg emissions for nuclear electricity generation technologies could be 9 to 110 g co2-eq kwh by 2050 it stated:
the collective lca literature indicates that life cycle ghg emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies
it added that for the most common category of reactors the light water reactor lwr:
harmonization decreased the median estimate for all lwr technology categories so that the medians of bwrs pwrs and all lwrs are similar at approximately 12 g co2-eq kwh
there are many options for lowering current levels of carbon emissions some options such as wind power and solar power produce low quantities of total life cycle carbon emissions using entirely renewable sources other options such as nuclear power produce a comparable amount of carbon dioxide emissions as renewable technologies in total life cycle emissions but consume non-renewable but sustainable materials uranium the term low carbon power can also include power that continues to utilize the world’s natural resources such as natural gas and coal but only when they employ techniques that reduce carbon dioxide emissions from these sources when burning them for fuel such as the as of 2012 pilot plants performing carbon capture and storage
as the single largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the united states the electric-power industry accounted for 39% of co2 emissions in 2004 a 27% increase since 1990 because the cost of reducing emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors such as transportation the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy
technologies to produce electric power with low-carbon emissions are already in use at various scales together they account for roughly 28% of all us electric-power production with nuclear power representing the majority 20% followed by hydroelectric power 7% however demand for power is increasing driven by increased population and per capita demand and low carbon power can supplement the supply needed
according to a transatlantic collaborative research paper on energy return on energy investederoei conducted by 6 analysts led by d weißbach and described as the most extensive overview so far based on a careful evaluation of available life cycle assessments which was published in the peer reviewed journal energy in 2013 the uncorrected for their intermittencyunbuffered eroei for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right while the bufferedcorrected for their intermittency eroei stated in the paper for all low carbon power sources with the exception of nuclear and biomass were yet lower still as when corrected for their weather intermittency buffered the eroei figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished - a reduction of eroei dependent on how reliant they are on back up energy sources
although the methodological integrity of this paper was challenged by marco raugei in late 2013 the authors of the initial paper responded to each of raugei's concerns in 2014 and after analysis each of raugei's concerns were summarized as not scientifically justified and based on faulty eroei understandings due to politically motivated energy evaluations
hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years hydropower is also an extremely flexible technology from the perspective of power grid operation large hydropower provides one of the lowest cost options in today’s energy market even compared to fossil fuels and there are no harmful emissions associated with plant operation
hydroelectric power is the world’s largest low carbon source of electricity supplying 16.6% of total electricity in 2014 china is the world's largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world followed by canada
however there are several significant social and environmental disadvantages of large-scale hydroelectric power systems: dislocation if people are living where the reservoirs are planned release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane during construction and flooding of the reservoir and disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife there is a strong consensus now that countries should adopt an integrated approach towards managing water resources which would involve planning hydropower development in co-operation with other water-using sectors
nuclear power with a 10.6% share of world electricity production as of 2013 is the second largest low-carbon power source
nuclear power in 2010 also provided two thirds2 3 of the twenty seven nation european union's low-carbon energy with for example some eu nations sourcing a considerable amount of their electricity from nuclear power for example france derives 79% of its electricity from nuclear
according to the iaea and european nuclear society worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries in 2013 china has 29 of these nuclear power

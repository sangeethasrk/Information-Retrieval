renewable energy in russia - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
renewable energy in russia mainly consists of hydroelectric energy the country is the fifth largest producer of renewable energy in the world although it is 56th when hydroelectric energy is not taken into account some 179 twh of russia's energy production comes from renewable energy sources out of a total economically feasible potential of 1823 twh 16% of russia's electricity is generated from hydropower and less than 1% is generated from all other renewable energy sources combined roughly 68% of russia's electricity is generated from thermal power and 16% from nuclear power
while most of the large hydropower plants in russia date from the soviet era the abundance of fossil fuels in the soviet union and the russian federation has resulted in little need for the development of other renewable energy sources there are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy which is strongly encouraged by the russian government russian president dmitry medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of russia's energy output and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in russia since 2008


most sources of renewable energy are new to russia and have experienced development in recent years however hydroelectric power has a long history in russia dating back to the soviet era the rapid expansion of hydroelectric power in the soviet union began in 1930 when the total installed capacity equaled 600 mwh the soviet union built its first windmill in 1941 which had a capacity of 100 kw by the time the soviet union collapsed in 1990 it had a total installed capacity of 65 gwh the largest dams that russia currently has including the sayano–shushenskaya dam were built in the 1950s and 1960s from the 1970s to 2000 the soviet union and russia focused mainly on traditional power sources: thermal- hydro- and nuclear power however in 1986 the soviet government announced new energy goals which included further hydroelectric plant construction as well as the start of small-scale solar and wind use for electricity production overall soviet energy policy focused on nuclear and thermal power although renewable energy was not completely neglected the dissolution of the soviet union prevented those goals from being fulfilled
the construction of the large dams prominent in soviet times largely ended in the 1990s with the creation of the russian federation in addition due to the post-soviet recession much of the country's infrastructure including dams fell into disrepair use of oil and gas for energy took priority in russia and renewable energy was ignored this policy lasted until 2008 when medvedev announced reforms to russia's energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy since then there has been rapid development of new renewable energy sources
russia is one of the world's largest producers of energy most of which it obtains from oil natural gas and coal the country's focus on those resources for production and export which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings means it has paid little attention to renewable energy out of the 203 gw of electric generation capacity that russia has 44 gw comes from hydroelectricity 307 mw from geothermal 15 mw from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources in 2009 the russian energy industry generated a total 992 twh of electricity 176 twh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations some of russia's hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment as shown by the accident at the sayano-shushenskaya hpp in 2009
president dmitry medvedev announced in may 2010 that the russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from renewable energy sources in an attempt to encourage development of renewable energy the government has plans for 4.5% of russia's energy output to come from non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources additionally in november 2010 the government approved a us$300 billion program to make factories and buildings more energy efficient it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants promote recycling and support the construction of a hybrid car plant medvedev announced in late 2009 that he wanted to cut russian energy consumption by 40% by 2020 at the moment development is slowed by low investment economic instability low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity subsidies for natural gas are another obstacle to renewable energy development
hydropower is the most used form of renewable energy in russia and there is large potential in russia for more use of hydropower russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100 mw making it fifth in the world for hydropower production it is also second in the world for hydro potential yet only 20% of this potential is developed russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources mostly in siberia and the country's far east at the end of 2005 the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in russia was 45,700 mw and an additional 5,648 mw was under construction the world energy council believes that russia has much potential for using its hydro resources with a theoretical potential of about 2,295 twh yr with 852 twh being economically feasible
the largest dams in russia are the sayano-shushenskaya dam which has an installed capacity of 6,400 mw the krasnoyarsk dam 6,000 mw the bratsk dam 4,500 mw the ust-ilimsk dam 4,320 mw and the zeya dam 1,330 mw some of the most recent dam projects are the bureya dam 2010 mw and the irganai dam 800 mw the boguchany dam 1920 mw zelenchuk dam 320 mw zaramag dam 352 mw and nizhne-chereksky 60 mw are currently under construction rushydro is the largest hydroelectric company in russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world in october 2010 china yangtze power the largest hydropower corporation in china and eurosibenergo a russian energy company signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in russia and export energy to china's northern territories the west siberian generating company has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the altai region before 2015
on 17 august 2009 there was an explosion at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric power plant which killed 75 plant workers and injured 13 the federal service for ecological technological and nuclear supervision's investigation concluded that poor management and technical flaws were responsible the explosion was caused by a 29-year-old turbine that experienced an uncontrolled and excessive vibration since then officials from rushydro the operator of the plant have called for better oversight and safety at hydroelectric plants
geothermal energy is the second most used form of renewable energy in russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production the first geothermal power plant in russia was built at pauzhetka kamchatka in 1966 with a capacity of 5 mw the total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79 mw with 50 mw coming from a plant at verkhne-mutnovsky russia is currently developing a 100 mw plant at mutnovsky and a 50 mw plant in kaliningrad most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the north caucasus and kamchatka half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes
in october 2010 sergei shmatko russia's energy minister stated that russia and iceland would work together to develop kamchatka's geothermal energy sources russia is also investigating foreign investment possibilities for developing geothermal energy in the kuril islands

solar energy is virtually nonexistent in russia despite its large potential in the country the first russian solar plant was opened in belgorod oblast in november 2010 russia has a total theoretical potential of 2,213 twh yr for solar energy with an economically feasible amount of 101 twh the southern parts of russia especially the north caucasus have the gr

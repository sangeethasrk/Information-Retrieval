radford’s theory of change shifted from viewing governments as arbitrators between public and private interests on environmental issues to finding that most governments are captured by industry rather than fighting first for new laws which could be blocked by industries he has focused on pressuring large companies to change their practices and enlisted them as allies in pushing for strong environmental protections examples include greenpeace campaigns that convinced apple inc and similar companies to shift to 100% clean energy and lobby utilities and regulators to make that possible as well as work to protect both the indonesian rainforest and the bering sea canyons radford argues that the combination of creating industry champions and “outside pressure” focused on the government are the keys to passing new laws to protect the environment however radford has also been a vocal leader calling for the united states to pass campaign finance reform and respect all americans' voting rights to shift power in politics from corporations towards people and fulfill the promise of american democracy radford is considered by many to be a modern-day transcendentalist in that he is very focused on nature and the environment and he is an advocate of democracy

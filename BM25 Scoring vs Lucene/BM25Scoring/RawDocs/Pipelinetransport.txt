pipeline transport - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
pipeline transport is the transportation of goods or material through a pipe the best data in 2014 gives a total of slightly less than 3.5 million km of pipeline in 120 countries of the world the united states had 65% russia had 8% and canada had 3% thus 75% of all pipeline was in three countries
pipeline and gas journal’s worldwide survey figures indicate that 118,623 miles 190,905 km of pipelines are planned and under construction of these 88,976 miles 143,193 km represent projects in the planning and design phase 29,647 miles 47,712 km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels - such as oil natural gas and biofuels - and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules
oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelines but accidents have been rare hydrogen pipeline transport is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe district heating or teleheating systems use a network of insulated pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer
pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material such as natural gas or oil pose special safety concerns and there have been various accidents pipelines can be the target of vandalism sabotage or even terrorist attacks in war pipelines are often the target of military attacks


it is uncertain when the first crude oil pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late 19th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a 2-inch 51 mm wrought iron pipeline over a 6-mile 9.7 km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the 1860s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land
natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of 125 pounds per square inch 860 kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg: propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure 100 psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than 125 psi 860 kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at 250 psi 1,700 kpa
the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of ngl processing plants are located in oil fields or close by when a number of pipelines tie into each other from various relatively close fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngl's in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane
the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of 2012 supplying 16 percent of all the natural gas used in ontario
this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only 1% of that of the trucking industry
to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota is williston north dakota only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the canadian border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of 2012 the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america
as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products will occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota's oil production has grown to 5 times in late 2012 compared to what it was just 6 years ago creating thousands of good paying long term jobs north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price but pipelines are cheaper rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery
enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west line 9 and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated 250,000 barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to 1.3 million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early 2014 new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port
although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships
the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer fracked oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota where one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water lies the pipeline will be 24-30 inches in diameter it will carry over 300,000 barrels of oil a day with a volatility of 32
the market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in 2008 the industry grew from $23 billion in 2006 to $39 billion in 2008 after faltering in 2009 demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew by 2012 almost 32,000 miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction
oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from 4 to 48 inches 100 to 1,220 mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about 3 to 6 feet 0.91 to 1.83 m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield high-density polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines
crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or go-devils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station down-stream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line
for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from 2 to 60 inches 51 to 1,524 mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority
highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelines however incidents on ammonia-transporting lines are uncommon - unlike on industrial ammonia-processing equipment a major ammonia pipeline is the ukrainian transammiak line connecting the togliattiazot facility in russia to the exporting black sea-port of odessa
pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and cost-effectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines
slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a 525-kilometre 326 mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minas-rio mine producing 26.5 million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the 85-kilometre 53 mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the world's first when it was built in 1967 it includes a 366-metre 1,201 ft bridge span at 167 metres 548 ft above the savage river
hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng the technology is proven most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every 50 to 100 miles 160 km an industrial production facility the 1938 rhine-ruhr 240-kilometre 150 mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation as of 2004 there are 900 miles 1,400 km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and 930 miles 1,500 km in europe
two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d 189 ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system
pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact
the 530 km 330 mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using 750 mm 30 inch pipe and completed in 1903 was the largest water supply scheme of its time
examples of significant water pipelines in south australia are the morgan-whyalla pipelne completed 1944 and mannum-adelaide completed 1955 pipelines both part of the larger snowy mountains scheme
there are two los angeles california aqueducts the owens valley aqueduct completed 1913 and the second los angeles aqueduct completed 1970 which also include extensive use of pipelines
the great manmade river of libya supplies 3,680,000 cubic metres 4,810,000 cu yd of water each day to tripoli benghazi sirte and several other cities in libya the pipeline is over 2,800 kilometres 1,700 mi long and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over 500 metres 1,600 ft underground
district heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10% as seen in norway's district heating network
district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either system
bars in the veltins-arena a major football ground in gelsenkirchen germany are interconnected by a 5-kilometre 3.1 mi long beer pipeline in randers city in denmark the so-called thor beer pipeline was operated originally copper pipes ran directly from the brewery but when the brewery moved out of the city in the 1990s thor beer replaced it with a giant tank
a beer pipeline has been proposed for construction in bruges belgium to reduce truck traffic on the city streets
the village of hallstatt in austria which is known for its long history of salt mining claims to contain the oldest industrial pipeline in the world dating back to 1595 it was constructed from 13,000 hollowed-out tree trunks to transport brine 40 kilometres 25 mi from hallstatt to ebensee
between 1978 and 1994 a 15 km milk pipeline ran between the dutch island of ameland and holwerd on the mainland of which 8 km beneath the wadden sea every day 30.000 litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland in 1994 the milk transport was abandoned
in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards
in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose:
when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pump compressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation
the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages:
russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops
field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gauges transmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations
the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections
pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline
the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands open close valves turn on off compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field
to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling operator training and
pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are:
since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run
pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines in third world countries product theft is a problem for pipeline companies it is common to find unauthorized extractions in the middle of the pipeline in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy
various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak
the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are:
where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker
as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases underground however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as trans-alaska-pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground
maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive
us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections 49 cfr 192 for natural gas pipelines and 49 cfr 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines
in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection
pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009 wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian state-owned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad
oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus
because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an above-ground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are well-established and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours
the keystone xl extension is designed to be buried under four feet of soil which will hinder post-spill vaporization of the carrier fraction diluent and bitumen will migrate at different rates depending on the temperature- and composition of the surrounding soils but separation will take place more slowly as the aromatics diffu

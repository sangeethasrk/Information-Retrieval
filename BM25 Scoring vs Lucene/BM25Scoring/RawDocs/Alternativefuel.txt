alternative fuel - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
alternative fuels known as non-conventional or advanced fuels are any materials or substances that can be used as fuels other than conventional fuels like fossil fuels petroleum oil coal and natural gas as well as nuclear materials such as uranium and thorium as well as artificial radioisotope fuels that are made in nuclear reactors
some well-known alternative fuels include biodiesel bioalcohol methanol ethanol butanol chemically stored electricity batteries and fuel cells hydrogen non-fossil methane non-fossil natural gas vegetable oil propane and other biomass sources


the main purpose of fuel is to store energy which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of use almost all fuels are chemical fuels the user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work such as powering an engine it may also be used to generate electricity which is then used for heating lighting or other purpose
biofuels are also considered a renewable source although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels
biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production
algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the us navy algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices
biodiesel is made from animal fats or vegetable oils renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha soybean sunflowers corn olive peanut palm coconut safflower canola sesame cottonseed etc once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol biodiesel is brought to life from this chemical reaction these raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions or used alone despite one’s mixture preference biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons than conventional diesel because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ulsd ultra-low sulfur diesel invention biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free
methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy these alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels butanol has another advantage: it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars
ammonia nh3 can be used as fuel benefits of ammonia include no need for oil zero emissions low cost and distributed production reducing transport and related pollution
carbon neutral fuel is synthetic fuel—such as methane gasoline diesel fuel or jet fuel—produced from renewable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater such fuels are potentially carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases to the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace fossil fuels or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation such carbon neutral and negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the sabatier reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas transported by pipeline truck or tanker ship or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the fischer–tropsch process to make traditional transportation or heating fuels
carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for distributed storage for renewable energy minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency and enabling transmission of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles germany has built a 250-kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts audi has constructed a carbon neutral liquefied natural gas lng plant in werlte germany the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their a3 sportback g-tron automobiles and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity other commercial developments are taking place in columbia south carolina camarillo california and darlington england
the least expensive source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion where it can be extracted for about us $7.50 per ton automobile exhaust gas capture has also been proposed to be economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about $50 per ton carbon capture from ambient air is more costly at between $600 and $1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration
nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day therefore the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the us averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009 but only 0.71 cents kwh during the least expensive six hours of the day typically wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents kwh during the day commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel the us navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon while that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010 it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue moreover since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon shipboard production is already much less expensive however us civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power the navy's estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than $1 per gallon
hydrogen is an emissionless fuel the byproduct of hydrogen burning is water although some mono-nitrogen oxides nox are produced when hydrogen is burned with air
hcng or h2cng is a mixture of compressed natural gas and 4-9 percent hydrogen by energy
liquid nitrogen is another type of emissionless and efficient fuel
the air engine is an emission-free piston engine using compressed air as fuel unlike hydrogen compressed air is about one-tenth as expensive as fossil fuel making it an economically attractive alternative fuel
propane is a cleaner burning high performance fuel derived from multiple sources it is known by many names including propane lpg liquified propane gas lpa liquid propane autogas autogas and others propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natu

endangered species - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
an endangered en species is a species which has been categorized by the international union for conservation of nature iucn red list as likely to become extinct endangered is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the iucn's schema after critically endangered cr
in 2012the iucn red list featured 3079 animal and 2655 plant species as endangered en worldwide the figures for 1998 were respectively 1102 and 1197
many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species: for example forbidding hunting restricting land development or creating preserves population numbers trends and species' conservation status can be found in the lists of organisms by population


the conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct many factors are considered when assessing the conservation status of a species eg such statistics as the number remaining the overall increase or decrease in the population over time breeding success rates or known threats the iucn red list of threatened species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system
over 40% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction internationally 199 countries have signed an accord to create biodiversity action plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species in the united states such plans are usually called species recovery plans
though labelled a list the iucn red list is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes data deficient dd species – species for which more data and assessment is required before their status may be determined – as well species comprehensively assessed by the iucn's species assessment process those species of near threatened nt and least concern lc status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations though these may be in decline unlike their more general use elsewhere the list uses the terms endangered species and threatened species with particular meanings: endangered en species lie between vulnerable vu and critically endangered cr species while threatened species are those species determined to be vulnerable endangered or critically endangered
the iucn categories with examples of animals classified by them include:
a reduction in population size based on any of the following:
b geographic range in the form of either b1 extent of occurrence or b2 area of occupancy or both:
c population estimated to number fewer than 2,500 mature individuals and either:
d population size estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals
e quantitative analysis showing the probability of extinction in the wild is at least 20% within 20 years or five generations whichever is the longer up to a maximum of 100 years
there is data from the united states that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species using species data from the database on the economics and management of endangered species demes database and the period that the endangered species act esa has been in existence 1970 to 1997 a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment as early as the 1800s humans began noticing the decline of certain species of animals in their usual habitats an example is the whooping crane once abundant from canada to mexico it was estimated in 1941 that only 16 birds remained in the wild another early example of mankind noticing the extinction of species was the introduction of “kudzu” in the southern united states this fast-growing plant took over the south growing on plants and trees and squelching the life out of them
under the endangered species act in the united states species may be listed as endangered or threatened the salt creek tiger beetle cicindela nevadica lincolniana is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the esa the us fish and wildlife service as well as the national marine fisheries service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species and adding a particular species to the list can be a long controversial process wilcove & master 2008 p 414
some endangered species laws are controversial typical areas of controversy include: criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered whether restrictions on land development constitute a taking of land by the government the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their lands and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws also lobbying from hunters and various industries like the petroleum industry construction industry and logging has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws
the bush administration lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species under the obama administration this policy has been reinstated
being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers this effect is potentially reducible such as in china where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species
another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the shoot shovel and shut-up method of clearing endangered species from an area of land some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it they have allegedly opted to silently kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat thus removing the problem from their land but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species the effectiveness of the endangered species act – which coined the term endangered species – has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool nineteen species have been delisted and recovered and 93% of listed species in the northeastern united states have a recovering or stable population
currently 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law this approximation however does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the endangered species act according to natureserve's global conservation status approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates excluding marine fish seventeen percent of vascular plants and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled thus in total between seven and eighteen percent of the united states' known animals fungi and plants are near extinction this total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the united states under the endangered species act
ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself over-hunting and fishing has been a large and dangerous problem of all the species who went extinct due to interference from mankind the dodo passenger pigeon great auk tasmanian tiger and steller's sea cow are some of the more well known examples with the bald eagle grizzly bear american bison timber wolf and sea turtle having been hunted to near-extinction many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport however due to major efforts to prevent extinction the bald eagle or haliaeetus leucocephalus is now under the category of least concern on the red list a present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced large whales like the blue whale bowhead whale finback whale gray whale sperm whale and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the endangered species list actions have been taken to attempt reduction in

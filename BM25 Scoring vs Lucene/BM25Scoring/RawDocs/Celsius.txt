celsius - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
celsius historically known as centigrade is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature as an si derived unit it is used by most countries in the world it is named after the swedish astronomer anders celsius 1701–1744 who developed a similar temperature scale the degree celsius °c can refer to a specific temperature on the celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty before being renamed to honour anders celsius in 1948 the unit was called centigrade from the latin centum which means 100 and gradus which means steps
from 1744 until 1954 0 °c was defined as the freezing point of water and 100 °c was defined as the boiling point of water both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere with mercury being the working material although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today by international agreement the unit degree celsius and the celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures: absolute zero and the triple point of vsmow specially purified water this definition also precisely relates the celsius scale to the kelvin scale which defines the si base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol k absolute zero the lowest temperature possible is defined as being precisely 0 k and −273.15 °c the temperature of the triple point of water is defined as precisely 273.16 k and 0.01 °c
this definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part in 273.16 approximately 0.00366 of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water thus it sets the magnitude of one degree celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same additionally it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely 273.15 degrees celsius −273.15 °c = 0 k and 0 °c = 273.15 k


in 1742 swedish astronomer anders celsius 1701–1744 created a temperature scale which was the reverse of the scale now known by the name celsius: 0 represented the boiling point of water while 100 represented the freezing point of water in his paper observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer he recounted his experiments showing that the melting point of ice is essentially unaffected by pressure he also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure he proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale being the boiling point would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level this pressure is known as one standard atmosphere the bipm's 10th general conference on weights and measures cgpm later defined one standard atmosphere to equal precisely 1013250dynes per square centimetre 101.325 kpa
in 1743 the lyonnais physicist jean-pierre christin permanent secretary of the académie des sciences belles-lettres et arts de lyon working independently of celsius developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water on 19 may 1743 he published the design of a mercury thermometer the thermometer of lyon built by the craftsman pierre casati that used this scale
in 1744 coincident with the death of anders celsius the swedish botanist carolus linnaeus 1707–1778 reversed celsius's scale his custom-made linnaeus-thermometer for use in his greenhouses was made by daniel ekström sweden's leading maker of scientific instruments at the time and whose workshop was located in the basement of the stockholm observatory as often happened in this age before modern communications numerous physicists scientists and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale among them were pehr elvius the secretary of the royal swedish academy of sciences which had an instrument workshop and with whom linnaeus had been corresponding daniel ekström the instrument maker and mårten strömer 1707–1770 who had studied astronomy under anders celsius
the first known swedish document reporting temperatures in this modern forward celsius scale is the paper hortus upsaliensis dated 16 december 1745 that linnaeus wrote to a student of his samuel nauclér in it linnaeus recounted the temperatures inside the orangery at the botanical garden of uppsala university:
since the caldarium the hot part of the greenhouse by the angle of the windows merely from the rays of the sun obtains such heat that the thermometer often reaches 30 degrees although the keen gardener usually takes care not to let it rise to more than 20 to 25 degrees and in winter not under 15 degrees
since the 19th century the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or when greater specificity was desired as degrees centigrade the symbol for temperature values on this scale is °c
because the term centigrade was also the spanish and french language name for a unit of angular measurement 1 100 of a right angle and had a similar connotation in other languages the term centesimal degree was used when very precise unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the bipm the 9th cgpm and the cipm comité international des poids et mesures formally adopted degree celsius symbol: °c in 1948
it was not until february 1985 that the forecasts issued by the bbc switched from centigrade to celsius
for scientific use celsius is the term usually used with centigrade otherwise continuing to be in common but decreasing use especially in informal contexts in english-speaking countries
some key temperatures relating the celsius scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below
the degree celsius has been the only si unit whose full unit name contains an uppercase letter since the si base unit for temperature the kelvin became the proper name in 1967 replacing the term degree kelvin the plural form is degrees celsius
the general rule of the international bureau of weights and measures bipm is that the numerical value always precedes the unit and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number eg 30.2 °c not 30.2°c or 30.2° c thus the value of the quantity is the product of the number and the unit the space being regarded as a multiplication sign just as a space between units implies multiplication the only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree minute and second for plane angle ° ′ and ″ respectively for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol other languages and various publishing houses may follow different typographical rules
unicode provides the celsius symbol at codepoint u+2103 ℃ degree celsius however this is a compatibility character provided for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character: in normal use it is better to represent degrees celsius °c with a sequence of u+00b0 ° degree sign + u+0043 c latin capital letter c rather than u+2103 ℃ degree celsius for searching treat these two sequences as identical
shown below is the degree celsius character followed immediately by the two-component version:
when viewed on computers that properly support unicode the above line may be similar to the image in the line below enlarged for clarity:
the canonical decomposition is simply an ordinary degree sign and c so some browsers may simply display °c in its place due to unicode normalization
the degree celsius is a special name for the kelvin for use in expressing celsius temperatures the degree celsius is also subject to the same rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol thus besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale eg gallium melts at 29.7646 °c and the temperature outside is 23 degrees celsius the degree celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature intervals: differences between temperatures or their uncertainties eg the output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees celsius and our standard uncertainty is ±3 °c because of

electricity generation - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from other sources of primary energy the fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the british scientist michael faraday his basic method is still used today: electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire or disc of copper between the poles of a magnet for electric utilities it is the first process in the delivery of electricity to consumers the other processes electricity transmission distribution and electrical power storage and recovery using pumped-storage methods are normally carried out by the electric power industry electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators primarily driven by heat engines fueled by chemical combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power and electrochemical batteries


central power stations became economically practical with the development of alternating current power transmission using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss electricity has been generated at central stations since 1882 the first power plants were run on water power or coal and today rely mainly on coal nuclear natural gas hydroelectric wind generators and petroleum with a small amount from solar energy tidal power and geothermal sources the use of power-lines and power-poles have been significantly important in the distribution of electricity
there are seven fundamental methods of directly transforming other forms of energy into electrical energy:
static electricity was the first form discovered and investigated and the electrostatic generator is still used even in modern devices such as the van de graaff generator and mhd generators charge carriers are separated and physically transported to a position of increased electric potential almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction in which mechanical energy forces an electrical generator to rotate there are many different methods of developing the mechanical energy including heat engines hydro wind and tidal power the direct conversion of nuclear potential energy to electricity by beta decay is used only on a small scale in a full-size nuclear power plant the heat of a nuclear reaction is used to run a heat engine this drives a generator which converts mechanical energy into electricity by magnetic induction most electric generation is driven by heat engines the combustion of fossil fuels supplies most of the heat to these engines with a significant fraction from nuclear fission and some from renewable sources the modern steam turbine invented by sir charles parsons in 1884 currently generates about 80% of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources
almost all electrical power on earth is generated with a turbine of some type turbines are commonly driven by wind water steam or burning gas the turbine drives an electric generator power sources include:
small electricity generators are often powered by reciprocating engines burning diesel biogas or natural gas diesel engines are often used for back up generation usually at low voltages however most large power grids also use diesel generators originally provided as emergency back up for a specific facility such as a hospital to feed power into the grid during certain circumstances biogas is often combusted where it is produced such as a landfill or wastewater treatment plant with a reciprocating engine or a microturbine which is a small gas turbine
unlike the solar heat concentrators mentioned above photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity although sunlight is free and abundant solar electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems until recently photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in germany japan and the united states
electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications currently most electrochemical power comes from closed electrochemical cells batteries
primary cells such as the common zinc-carbon batteries act as power sources directly but many types of cells are used as storage systems rather than primary generation systems
open electrochemical systems known as fuel cells have been undergoing a great deal of research and development in the last few years fuel cells can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels mainly electrolytic hydrogen and so can be viewed as either generation systems or storage systems depending on their use
various other technologies have been studied and developed for power generation
solid-state generation without moving parts is of particular interest in portable applications this area is largely dominated by thermoelectric te devices though thermionic ti and thermophotovoltaic tpv systems have been developed as well typically te devices are used at lower temperatures than ti and tpv systems
piezoelectric devices are used for power generation from mechanical strain particularly in power harvesting
betavoltaics are another type of solid-state power generator which produces electricity from radioactive decay fluid-based magnetohydrodynamic mhd power generation has been studied as a method for extracting electrical power from nuclear reactors and also from more conventional fuel combustion systems osmotic power finally is another possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges eg deltas 
the perth wave energy project is an early production submerged buoy electrical power and direct desalination installation supplying power to hmas stirling in western australia
the selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region the economics vary considerably around the world resulting in widespread selling prices eg the price in venezuela is 3 cents per kwh while in denmark it is 40 cents per kwh hydroelectric plants nuclear power plants thermal power plants and renewable sources have their own pros and cons and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand all power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load supplied by plants which run continuously nuclear coal oil and gas plants can supply base load
thermal energy is economical in areas of high industrial density as the high demand cannot be met by renewable sources the effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas these plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit however recent disasters in japan have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power it is not an economically viable source of production where the load varies too much during the annual production cycle and the ability to store the flow of water is limited
due to advancements in technology and with mass production

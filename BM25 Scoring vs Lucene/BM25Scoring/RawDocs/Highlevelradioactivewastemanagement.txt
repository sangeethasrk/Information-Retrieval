high-level radioactive waste management - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
high-level radioactive waste management concerns how radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power and nuclear weapons are dealt with radioactive waste contains a mixture of short-lived and long-lived nuclides as well as non-radioactive nuclides there was reported some 47,000 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste stored in the usa in 2002 nuclear waste is approximately 94% uranium 1.3% plutonium 0.14% other actinides and 5.2% fission products about 1.0% of this waste consists of long-lived isotopes se zr te pd sn i and cs shorter lived isotopes including sr sr ru sn cs cs and pm constitute 0.9% at one year decreasing to 0.1% at 100 years the remaining 3.3-4.1% consists of non-radioactive isotopes one tonne of waste as described above has measurable radioactivity of approximately 600 tbq equal to the natural radioactivity in one km of the earth's crust which if buried would add measurable 25 parts per trillion to the total radioactivity
the difference between short-lived high-level nuclear waste and long-lived low-level waste can be illustrated by the following example as stated above one mole of both i and i release 3x10 decays in a period equal to one half-life i decays with the release of 970 kev whilst i decays with the release of 194 kev of energy 131gm of i would therefore release 45 gigajoules over eight days beginning at an initial rate of 600 ebq releasing 90 kilowatts with the last radioactive decay occurring inside two years in contrast 129gm of i would therefore release 9 gigajoules over 15.7 million years beginning at an initial rate of 850 mbq releasing 25 microwatts with the radioactivity decreasing by less than 1% in 100,000 years
radionuclides such as i or i may be highly radioactive or very long-lived but they cannot be both one mole of i129 grams undergoes the same number of decays3x10 in 15.7 million years as does one mole of i131 grams in 8 days i is therefore highly radioactive but disappears very quickly whilst i releases a very low level of radiation for a very long time two long-lived fission products technetium-99 half-life 220,000 years and iodine-129 half-life 15.7 million yearsare of somewhat greater concern because of a greater chance of entering the biosphere the transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium-237 half-life two million years and plutonium-239 half-life 24,000 years will also remain in the environment for long periods of time a more complete solution to both the problem of both actinides and to the need for low-carbon energy may be the integral fast reactor one tonne of nuclear waste after a complete burn in an ifr reactor will have prevented 500 million tonnes of co2 from entering the atmosphere otherwise waste storage usually necessitates treatment followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form the most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium-237 half-life two million years and plutonium-239 half-life 24,000 years consequently high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the biosphere this usually necessitates treatment followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form
radioactive decay follows the half-life rule which means that the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay in other words the radiation from a long-lived isotope like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of short-lived isotope like iodine-131
governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options usually involving deep-geologic placement although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions this is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses
thus alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: 1 stable geological formations and 2 stable human institutions over hundreds of thousands of years as alfvén suggests no known human civilization has ever endured for so long and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period nevertheless avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'
there is a debate over what should constitute an acceptable scientific and engineering foundation for proceeding with radioactive waste disposal strategies there are those who have argued on the basis of complex geochemical simulation models that relinquishing control over radioactive materials to geohydrologic processes at repository closure is an acceptable risk they maintain that so-called natural analogues inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary however existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined: due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations the accuracy of computer simulation models has not been verified by empirical observation certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half-lives of high-level radioactive waste on the other hand some insist deep geologic repositories in stable geologic formations are necessary national management plans of various countries display a variety of approaches to resolving this debate
researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such long periods should be examined critically practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned long term behaviour of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research management strategies and implementation plans of several representative national governments are described below


the international panel on fissile materials has said:
it is widely accepted that spent nuclear fuel and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use there is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface
the process of selecting appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017 the basic concept is to locate a large stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel or large-bore tunnel boring machines similar to those used to drill the chunnel from england to france to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste the goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment however many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent
because some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account moreover it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to no longer be lethal to living organisms a 1983 review of the swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the national academy of sciences found that country’s estimate of several hundred thousand years—perhaps up to one million years—being necessary for waste isolation fully justified
the proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement this method has been described as a viable means of disposing of radioactive waste and as a state-of-the-art nuclear waste disposal technology
in nature sixteen repositories were discovered at the oklo mine in gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago the fission products in these natural formations were found to have moved less than 10 ft 3 m over this period though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack
in order to store the high level radioactive waste in long-term geological depositories specific waste forms need to be used which will allow the radioactivity to decay away while the materials retain their integrity for thousands of years the materials being used can be broken down into a few classes: glass waste forms ceramic waste forms and nanostructured materials
the glass forms include borosilicate glasses and phosphate glasses borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste in many countries which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry the glass waste forms have the advantage of being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions they are easy to scale up to industrial processing and they are stable against thermal radiative and chemical perturbations these glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses which make them a more favorable option however no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements
the ceramic waste forms offer higher waste loadings than the glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure also mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms provide evidence for long term durability due to this fact and the fact that they can be processed at lower temperatures ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms ceramic waste forms offer great potential but a lot of research remains to be done
finland the united states and sweden are the most advanced in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing with france and japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing the country-specific status of high-level waste management plans are described below
in many european countries eg britain finland the netherlands sweden and switzerland the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the international commission on radiation protection or proposed in the united states european limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the international commission on radiation protection by a factor of 20 and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the us environmental protection agency epa for yucca mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure moreover the us epa’s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the european limit
the countries that have made the most progress towards a repository for high-level radioactive waste have typically started with public consultations and made voluntary siting a necessary condition this consensus seeking approach is believed to have a greater chance of success than top-down modes of decision making but the process is necessarily slow and there is inadequate experience around the world to know if it will succeed in all existing and aspiring nuclear nations
moreover most communities do not want to host a nuclear waste repository as they are concerned about their community becoming a de facto site for waste for thousands of years the health and environmental consequences of an accident and lower property values
in the peoples republic of china ten reactors provide about 2% of electricity and five more are under construction china made a commitment to reprocessing in the 1980s a pilot plant is under construction at lanzhou where a temporary spent fuel storage facility has been constructed geological disposal has been studied since 1985 and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003 sites in gansu province near the gobi desert in northwestern china are under investigation with a final site expected to be selected by 2020 and actual disposal by about 2050
in the republic of china nuclear waste storage facility was built at the southern tip of orchid island in taitung county offshore of taiwan island the facility was built in 1982 and it is owned and operated by taipower the facility receives nuclear waste from taipower's current three nuclear power plants however due to the strong resistance from local community in the island the nuclear waste has to be stored at the power plant facilities themselves
sixteen nuclear reactors produce about 3% of india’s electricity and seven more are under construction spent fuel is processed at facilities in trombay near mumbai at tarapur on the west coast north of mumbai and at kalpakkam on the southeast coast of india plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor under construction to produce more fuel and other waste vitrified at tarapur and trombay interim storage for 30 years is expected with eventual disposal in a deep geological repository in crystalline rock near kalpakkam
in 2000 a specified radioactive waste final disposal act called for creation of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste and later that year the nuclear waste management organization of japan numo was established under the jurisdiction of the ministry of economy trade and industry numo is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site construction operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040 site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities but by 2006 no local government had volunteered to host the facility kōchi prefecture showed interest in 2007 but its mayor resigned due to local opposition in december 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities
the head of the science council of japan’s expert panel has said japan's seismic conditions makes it difficult to predict ground conditions over the necessary 100,000 years so it will be impossible to convince the public of the safety of deep geological disposal
belgium has seven nuclear reactors that provide about 52% of its electricity belgian spent nuclear fuel was initially sent for reprocessing in france in 1993 reprocessing was suspended following a resolution of the belgian parliament spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants the deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste hlw has been studied in belgium for more than 30 years boom clay is studied as a reference host formation for hlw disposal the hades underground research laboratory url is located at −223 m in the boom formation at the mol site the belgian url is operated by the euridice economic interest group a joint organisation between sck•cen the belgian nuclear research centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ondraf niras the belgian agency for radioactive waste management in belgium the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the federal agency of nuclear control created in 2001
in 1983 the government decided to select a site for permanent repository by 2010 with four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity finland in 1987 enacted a nuclear energy act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal subject to requirements of its radiation and nuclear safety authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located producers of nuclear waste organized the company posiva with responsibility for site selection construction and operation of a permanent repository a 1994 amendment to the act required final disposal of spent fuel in finland prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste
environmental assessment of four sites occurred in 1997–98 posiva chose the olkiluoto site near two existing reactors and the local government approved it in 2000 the finnish parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock at a depth of about 500 meters in 2001 the repository concept is similar to the swedish model with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020 an underground characterization facility onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository was under construction at the site in 2012
with 58 nuclear reactors contributing about 75% of its electricity the highest percentage of any country france has been reprocessing its spent reactor fuel since the introduction of nuclear power there some reprocessed plutonium is used to make fuel but more is being produced than is being recycled as reactor fuel france also reprocesses spent fuel for other countries but the nuclear waste is returned to the country of origin radioactive waste from reprocessing french spent fuel is expected to be disposed of in a geological repository pursuant to legislation enacted in 1991 that established a 15-year period for conducting radioactive waste management research under this legislation partition and transmutation of long-lived elements immobilization and conditioning processes and long-term near surface storage are being investigated by the commissariat à l’energie atomique cea disposal in deep geological formations is being studied by the french agency for radioactive waste management l'agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs in underground research labs
three sites were identified for possible deep geologic disposal in clay near the border of meuse and haute-marne near gard and at vienne in 1998 the government approved the meuse haute marne underground research laboratory a site near meuse haute-marne and dropped the others from further consideration legislation was proposed in 2006 to license a repository by 2015 with operations expected in 2025
nuclear waste policy in germany is in flux german planning for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974 focused on salt dome gorleben a salt mine near gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of braunschweig the site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant spent fuel management and permanent disposal facilities at a single site plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979 in 2000 the federal government and utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power closing one reactor in 2003
within days of the march 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster chancellor angela merkel imposed a three-month moratorium on previously announced extensions for germany's existing nuclear power plants while shutting seven of the 17 reactors that had been operating since 1981 protests continued and on 29 may 2011 merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022
meanwhile electric utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim storage facilities at gorleben lubmin and ahaus until temporary storage facilities can be built near reactor sites previously spent fuel was sent to france or the united kingdom for reprocessing but this practice was ended in july 2005
in russia the ministry of atomic energy minatom is responsible for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16% of its electricity minatom is also responsible for reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal including over 25,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in temporary storage in 2001
russia has a long history of reprocessing spent fuel for military purposes and previously planned to reprocess imported spent fuel possibly including some of the 33,000 metric tons of spent fuel accumulated at sites in other countries who received fuel from the us which the us originally pledged to take back such as brazil the czech republic india japan mexico slovenia south korea switzerland taiwan and the european union
an environmental protection act in 1991 prohibited importing radioactive material for long-term storage or burial in russia but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage was passed by the russian parliament and signed by president putin in 2001 in the long term the russian plan is for deep geologic disposal most attention has been paid to locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at mayak near chelyabinsk in the ural mountains and in granite at krasnoyarsk in siberia
in sweden there are ten operating nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity two other reactors in barsebäck were shut down in 1999 and 2005 when these reactors were built it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to sweden later construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated but has not been built
passage of the stipulation act of 1977 transferred responsibility for nuclear waste management from the government to the nuclear industry requiring reactor operators to present an acceptable plan for waste management with absolute safety in order to obtain an operating license in early 1980 after the three mile island meltdown in the united states a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in sweden in late 1980 after a three-question referendum produced mixed results the swedish parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010 in 2010 the swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors the new units can only be built at the existing nuclear power sites oskarshamn ringhals or forsmark and only to replace one of the existing reactors that will have to be shut down for the new one to be able to start up
the swedish nuclear fuel and waste management company svensk kärnbränslehantering ab known as skb was created in 1980 and is responsible for final disposal of nuclear waste there this includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility the central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel at oskarshamn about 150 miles south of stockholm on the baltic coast transportation of spent fuel and construction of a permanent repository swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at oskarshamn where it will be stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository
conceptual design of a permanent repository was determined by 1983 calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground below the water table in what is known as the kbs-3 method space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay after examining six possible locations for a permanent repository three were nominated for further investigation at osthammar oskarshamn and tierp on 3 june 2009 swedish nuclear fuel and waste co chose a lo

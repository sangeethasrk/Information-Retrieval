international energy agency - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the international energy agency iea french: agence internationale de l'énergie is a paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization established in the framework of the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd in 1974 in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis the iea was initially dedicated to responding to physical disruptions in the supply of oil as well as serving as an information source on statistics about the international oil market and other energy sectors
the iea acts as a policy adviser to its member states but also works with non-member countries especially china india and russia the agency's mandate has broadened to focus on the 3es of effectual energy policy: energy security economic development and environmental protection the latter has focused on mitigating climate change the iea has a broad role in promoting alternate energy sources including renewable energy rational energy policies and multinational energy technology co-operation
iea member countries are required to maintain total oil stock levels equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports at the end of july 2009 iea member countries held a combined stockpile of almost 4.3 billion barrels 680,000,000 m of oil
on 1 september 2015 fatih birol took office as the new executive director succeeding in this position former dutch minister of economic affairs maria van der hoeven


the iea was established to meet the industrial countries' energy organization needs in the wake of the 1973–1974 oil crisis although the oecd had structures such as the council the executive committee the oil committee and the energy committee that could potentially deal with energy questions it could not respond effectively to the crisis the oecd had adopted the oil apportionment decision c72201final laying out procedures to be carried out in the event of an oil supply emergency in europe but these procedures were not implemented during the crisis in addition the oecd had adopted recommendations on oil stockpiling in europe but due to their limited scope these measures could have only a limited role in an oil supply emergency
establishment of the new organization was proposed by united states secretary of state henry kissinger in his address to the pilgrims society in london on 12 december 1973 also in december 1973 at the summit of the european communities in copenhagen danish prime minister anker jørgensen who chaired the summit declared that the summit found it useful to study with other oil-consuming countries within the framework of the oecd ways of dealing with the common short and long term energy problems of consumer countries
at the washington energy conference on 11–13 february 1974 the ministers of thirteen principal oil consumer countries stated the need for a comprehensive action program to deal with all facets of the world energy situation by cooperative measures in so doing they will build on the work of the oecd
while creating a new energy organization it was decided to utilize the framework of the oecd as it had experience in dealing with oil and other energy questions had expertise in economic analysis and statistics had established staff physical facilities legal status and privileges and immunities and was the principal organization of the industrial countries however the oecd has a rule of unanimity and not all member states were ready to participate therefore instead of an integrated approach an autonomous approach was chosen
the iea was created on 18 november 1974 by the agreement on an international energy program iep agreement
during its history the iea has intervened in oil markets three times by releasing oil stocks – in 1991 during the gulf war in 2005 by releasing 2 million barrels per day 320×10  m d for a month after hurricane katrina affected us production and most recently in 2011 to offset continued disruption to oil supplies as a result of the 2011 libyan civil war
in april 2001 the iea in collaboration with five other international organisations apec eurostat olade opec unsd launched the joint oil data exercise which in 2005 became the joint organisations data initiative jodi
in june 2014 in its world energy outlook report the iae warned us$48 trillion in investment and credible long term policy planning would be required between 2014 and 2035 to secure sufficient energy supplies for that period the reliability and sustainability of our future energy system depends on investment but this won't materialize unless there are credible policy frameworks in place as well as stable access to long-term sources of finance neither of these conditions should be taken for granted van der hoeven said in a statement accompanying the report
only the oecd member states can become members of the iea except for chile iceland israel mexico and slovenia all oecd member states are members of the iea in 2014 estonia joined the iea and became its 29th member
ahead of the launch of the 2009 world energy outlook the british daily newspaper the guardian referring to an unidentified senior iea official alleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of peak oil under pressures from the usa according to a second unidentified former senior iea official it was imperative not to anger the americans and that the world has already entered the peak oil zone
the guardian also referred to a team of scientists from uppsala university in sweden who studied the 2008 world energy outlook and concluded the forecasts of the iea were unattainable according to their peer-reviewed report oil production in 2030 would not exceed 75 million barrels per day 11.9×10  m d while the iea forecasts a production of 105 million barrels per day 16.7×10  m d the lead author of the report dr kjell aleklett has claimed that iea's reports are political documents
the anticorruption ngo global witness wrote in its report heads in the sand that global witness' analysis demonstrates that the agency continues to retain an overly-optimistic and therefore misleading view about potential future oil production according to global witness the agency's over-confidence despite credible data external analysis and underlying fundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach has had a disastrous global impact
in the past the iea has been criticized by environmental groups for underplaying the role of renewable energy technologies in favor of nuclear and fossil-fuels in 2009 guy pearse stated that the iea has consistently underestimated the potential for renewable energy alternatives
the energy watch group ewg a coalition of scientists and politicians which analyses official energy industry predictions claims that the iea has had an institutional bias towards traditional energy sources and has been using misleading data to undermine the case for renewable energy such as wind and solar a 2008 ewg report compares iea projections about the growth of wind power capacity and finds that it has consistently underestimated the amount of energy the wind power industry can deliver
for example in 1998 the iea predicted global wind electricity generation would total 47.4 gw by 2020 but ewg's report states that this level was reached by the end of 2004 the report also said that the iea has not learned the lesson of previous underestimates and last year net additions of wind power globally were four times greater than the average iea estimate from its 1995-2004 predictions
amid discontent from across the renewables sector at the iea's performance as a global energy watchdog the international renewable energy agency was formed on january 26 2009 the aim is to have the agency fully operational by 2010 with an initial annual budget of €25m
iea bioenergy was set up in 1978 by the international energy agency iea with the aim of improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programmes in bioenergy research development and deployment
the international energy agency acts as energy policy advisor to 28 member countries plus the european commission in their effort to ensurereliable affordable a

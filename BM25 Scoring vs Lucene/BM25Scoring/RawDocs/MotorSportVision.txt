motorsport vision was founded by john britten sir peter ogden and jonathan palmer who won the formula two championship in 1983 and competed in 88 formula one grands prix over the next six years
msv is famous for buying brands hatch oulton park snetterton and cadwell park in 2004 and working to modernise their facilities and customer care brands hatch the former venue for the british grand prix has begun hosting international car racing again - events either joining or back on its calendar include the dtm german touring car championship the fia world touring car championship and the a1gp world cup of motorsport
in 2006 msv formed motorsport vision racing msvr providing a complete car and bike racing organisation capability to the motorsport vision group msvr organises over 30 events annually across 10 uk circuits motorsport vision's trackday division club msv has grown to become one of the uk's biggest trackday companies in the past four years and organises novice events up to advanced driver training days alongside palmersport msv also run driving experiences at brands hatch and oulton park
msv also ran the formula palmer audi championship from 1998 to 2010 which advanced the careers of hundreds of young hopefuls nine of whom have made it all the way to formula one in 2008 msv also acquired the rights to the british superbike championship which has already seen the considerable benefits of msv's commercial administrative and organisational expertise
in september 2008 motorsport vision won an fia tender to supply cars and operate the fia formula two championship a new international single seater series derived from an fia initiative to provide young talented drivers with the opportunity to compete in top-level racing on a competitive budget the formula two cars like formula palmer audi were assembled and prepared in a dedicated facility at bedford autodrome also home to palmersport and fpa this category was discontinued after 2010
one of its founders john britten died on 25 november 2009 after a long period of illness
in 1986 john foulston bought brands hatch oulton park and snetterton circuits from grovewood securities and established the brands hatch leisure bhl company the following year the company acquired cadwell park before foulston died testing a mclaren canam car at silverstone ownership of bhl passed to his wife mary but the company was run by john webb until 1990 when daughter nicola foulston took over the running in that time brands hatch hosted higher-profile series such as formula 3000 and superbike world championship racing 1988 saw further changes to the circuit layout with a chicane added at dingle dell corner while westfield bend and graham hill bend were tightened new pits and a corporate entertainment facility were added in the late-1990s
in 1999 foulston announced that brands hatch had acquired the rights to the british grand prix from 2002 whilst discussions were ongoing with regards to planning permission to bring the circuit up to f1 requirements foulston sold bhl to octagon motorsports a subsidiary of interpublic for £120 m octagon however failed to obtain the necessary planning permission and instead decided to lease silverstone in order to host the grand prix however high-profile single-seater racing did return to brands hatch in 2003 when a round of the cart series was held at the circuit despite attracting around 40,000 spectators the race was not retained for subsequent seasons
with financial pressures stemming from running the british grand prix octagon sold off the group of four circuits including brands hatch to the motorsport vision group headed by ex-f1 driver jonathan palmer in 2004
after many years of decay oulton was given new life when it along with brands hatch snetterton and cadwell park was bought by motorsport vision msv headed by ex-f1 racer jonathan palmer have completely turned the circuits around tidying them up and pulling the crowds in
oulton park has always been acknowledged as one of the most picturesque circuits in the uk and under msv's guidance big meetings have thrived at the cheshire track including the british touring car championship two rounds of the british superbike championship and the gold cup classic car meeting dubbed 'the goodwood of the north'
in 2007 oulton park was voted the best uk circuit by british superbike fans whilst a btcc meeting on sunday 27 july 2008 saw a crowd of 35,000 attend - a record not only for the circuit but the highest crowd at any venue of the btcc for a decade
snetterton has undergone perhaps the most radical transformation of all the motorsport vision circuits since being taken over in 2004
new spectator banking has been added to the track to improve circuit views whilst the restaurant and toilet facilities have been updated or replaced a new scrutineering bay has also been added
snetterton is well known for being one of the fastest tracks in the uk thanks to its combination of several long straights and relatively few corners the lap record currently stands at 56.095 seconds or an average speed of 125.27 mph
in 1953 the track was lengthened to 1.3 miles 2.1 km upon the invitation of the 500 cc motorcycle-engined formula 3 to race in a traditional bike meeting around 30,000 spectators attended that particular race the original track grew to the current 2.25 miles 3.62 km layout in 1962 and hosted the british f3 series the next may some of the bends are named after family members eg mansfield charlie and chris cadwell is now considered too narrow for high level car races although club motorsport associations such as the barc and 750mc still hold meetings the layout is ideal for bikes however with the british superbike championship round being the most popular event on the championship's calendar several tests and feature clips for the motoring program fifth gear have been filmed here
the track in thurleigh near bedford is owned by motorsport vision no official motorsport events are held at the circuit but it is a popular public track day circuit it is also the home of the jaguar slikcat which is used for corporate events and for ride alongs during the track days it is served by bedford aerodrome
msv will build a circuit at the former laon-couvron air base in france 120 km northeast of paris
in 2012 motorsport vision will host several prestigious international events such as the dtm german touring cars and the revived fia formula two championship
alongside these motorsport vision's circuits will host the british superbike championship british touring car championship the british f3 and gt championships and a range of historic events including the oulton park gold cup
there will also be numerous bike and car club meetings throughout the year including the britcar 'into the night' race at brands hatch
in 2008 motorsport vision took over the responsibility for the organisation and promotion of the british superbike championship from dorna the 2008 season was msv's first in charge and saw shane byrne take the title the championship was screened live by british eurosport and highlights were shown later on channel 4
formula palmer audi commonly known as fpa was founded in 1998 by jonathan palmer the ethos of fpa is to keep costs at a minimum whilst at all times promoting incredibly competitive and professional racing the series is most famous for producing ex-f1 driver and indycar race-winner justin wilson and helping the career of triple world touring car champion andy priaulx
in order to keep a level playing field as much as possible all the formula palmer audi cars are run by a specialist team of fpa mechanics rather than having separate teams this concept of a large group of deliberately equalised cars has since been adopted by a1gp
fpa has recently announced a scholarship prize with the brdc stars of tomorrow kf2 karting championship and with the new

tidal power - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
tidal power also called tidal energy is a form of hydropower that converts the energy obtained from tides into useful forms of power mainly electricity
although not yet widely used tidal power has potential for future electricity generation tides are more predictable than wind energy and solar power among sources of renewable energy tidal power has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities thus constricting its total availability however many recent technological developments and improvements both in design eg dynamic tidal power tidal lagoons and turbine technology eg new axial turbines cross flow turbines indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels
historically tide mills have been used both in europe and on the atlantic coast of north america the incoming water was contained in large storage ponds and as the tide went out it turned waterwheels that used the mechanical power it produced to mill grain the earliest occurrences date from the middle ages or even from roman times it was only in the 19th century that the process of using falling water and spinning turbines to create electricity was introduced in the us and europe
the world's first large-scale tidal power plant is the rance tidal power station in france which became operational in 1966 it was the largest tidal power station in terms of power output before sihwa lake tidal power station surpassed it total harvestable energy from tidal areas close to the coast is estimated to be around 1 terawatt worldwide


tidal power is taken from the earth's oceanic tides tidal forces are periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies these forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world's oceans due to the strong attraction to the oceans a bulge in the water level is created causing a temporary increase in sea level when the sea level is raised water from the middle of the ocean is forced to move toward the shorelines creating a tide this occurrence takes place in an unfailing manner due to the consistent pattern of the moon’s orbit around the earth the magnitude and character of this motion reflects the changing positions of the moon and sun relative to the earth the effects of earth's rotation and local geography of the sea floor and coastlines
tidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the earth–moon system and to a lesser extent in the earth–sun system other natural energies exploited by human technology originate directly or indirectly with the sun including fossil fuel conventional hydroelectric wind biofuel wave and solar energy nuclear energy makes use of earth's mineral deposits of fissionable elements while geothermal power taps the earth's internal heat which comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion about 20% and heat produced through radioactive decay 80%
a tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into electricity greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation
because the earth's tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the moon and sun and the earth's rotation tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a renewable energy resource movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the earth–moon system: this is a result of pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence this loss of energy has caused the rotation of the earth to slow in the 4.5 billion years since its formation during the last 620 million years the period of rotation of the earth length of a day has increased from 21.9 hours to 24 hours in this period the earth has lost 17% of its rotational energy while tidal power will take additional energy from the system the effect is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years
tidal power can be classified into four generating methods:
tidal stream generators or tsgs make use of the kinetic energy of moving water to power turbines in a similar way to wind turbines that use wind to power turbines some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges involving virtually no aesthetic problems land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites which can be captured with the use of turbines these turbines can be horizontal vertical open or ducted and are typically placed near the bottom of the water column
tidal barrages make use of the potential energy in the difference in height or hydraulic head between high and low tides when using tidal barrages to generate power the potential energy from a tide is seized through strategic placement of specialized dams when the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in the temporary increase in tidal power is channeled into a large basin behind the dam holding a large amount of potential energy with the receding tide this energy is then converted into mechanical energy as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators barrages are essentially dams across the full width of a tidal estuary
dynamic tidal power or dtp is an untried but promising technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows it proposes that very long dams for example: 30–50 km length be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean without enclosing an area tidal phase differences are introduced across the dam leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas – featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the uk china and korea
a newer tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides the created reservoirs are similar to those of tidal barrages except that the location is artificial and does not contain a preexisting ecosystem the lagoons can also be in double or triple format without pumping or with pumping that will flatten out the power output the pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near base load production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage the proposed tidal lagoon swansea bay in wales united kingdom would be the first tidal power station of this type once built
the first study of large scale tidal power plants was by the us federal power commission in 1924 which if built would have been located in the northern border area of the us state of maine and the south eastern border area of the canadian province of new brunswick with various dams powerhouses and ship locks enclosing the bay of fundy and passamaquoddy bay note: see map in reference nothing came of the study and it is unknown whether canada had been approached about the study by the us federal power commission
in 1956 utility nova scotia light and power of halifax commissioned a pair of studies into the feasibility of commercial tidal power development on the nova scotia side of the bay of fundy the two studies by stone & webster of boston and by montreal engineering company of montreal independently concluded that millions of horsepower could be harnessed from fundy but that development costs would be commercially prohibitive at that time
there was also a report on the international commission in april 1961 entitled investigation of the international passamaquoddy t

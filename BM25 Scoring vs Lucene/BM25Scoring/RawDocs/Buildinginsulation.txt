building insulation - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
building insulation refers broadly to any object in a building used as insulation for any purpose while the majority of insulation in buildings is for thermal purposes the term also applies to acoustic insulation fire insulation and impact insulation eg for vibrations caused by industrial applications often an insulation material will be chosen for its ability to perform several of these functions at once


thermal insulation in buildings is an important factor to achieving thermal comfort for its occupants insulation reduces unwanted heat loss or gain and can decrease the energy demands of heating and cooling systems it does not necessarily deal with issues of adequate ventilation and may or may not affect the level of sound insulation in a narrow sense insulation can just refer to the insulation materials employed to slow heat loss such as: cellulose glass wool rock wool polystyrene urethane foam vermiculite perlite wood fibre plant fibre cannabis flax cotton cork etc recycled cotton denim plant straw animal fibre sheep's wool cement and earth or soil reflective insulation also known as radiant barrier but it can also involve a range of designs and techniques to address the main modes of heat transfer - conduction radiation and convection materials many of the materials in this list deal with heat conduction and convection by the simple expedient of trapping large amounts of air or other gas in a way that results in a material that employs the low thermal conductivity of small pockets of gas rather than the much higher conductivity of typical solids a similar gas-trapping principle is used in animal hair down feathers and in air-containing insulating fabrics
the effectiveness of reflective insulation radiant barrier is commonly evaluated by the reflectivity emittance of the surface with airspace facing to the heat source
the effectiveness of bulk insulation is commonly evaluated by its r-value of which there are two - metric si and us customary the former being 0.176 times the latter for attics it is recommended that it should be at least r-38 us customary r-6.7 metric however an r-value does not take into account the quality of construction or local environmental factors for each building construction quality issues include inadequate vapor barriers and problems with draft-proofing in addition the properties and density of the insulation material itself is critical
how much insulation a house should have depends on building design climate energy costs budget and personal preference regional climates make for different requirements building codes specify only the bare minimum insulating beyond what the code requires is often recommended
the insulation strategy of a building needs to be based on a careful consideration of the mode of energy transfer and the direction and intensity in which it moves this may alter throughout the day and from season to season it is important to choose an appropriate design the correct combination of materials and building techniques to suit the particular situation
to determine whether you should add insulation you first need to find out how much insulation you already have in your home and where a qualified home energy auditor will include an insulation check as a routine part of a whole-house energy audit
an initial estimate of insulation needs in the united states can be determined by the us department of energy's zip code insulation calculator
in russia the luxury of cheap gas has led to poorly insulated overheated and inefficient consumers of energy the russian center for energy efficiency found that russian buildings are either over- or under-heated and often consume up to fifty percent more heat and hot water than needed fifty-three percent of all carbon dioxide co2 emissions in russia are produced through heating and generating electricity for buildings however greenhouse gas emissions from the former soviet bloc are still below their 1990 levels
in cold conditions the main aim is to reduce heat flow out of the building the components of the building envelope - windows doors roofs walls and air infiltration barriers - are all important sources of heat loss in an otherwise well insulated home windows will then become an important source of heat transfer the resistance to conducted heat loss for standard glazing corresponds to an r-value of about 0.17 mk w compared to 2-4 mk w for glass wool batts losses can be reduced by good weatherisation bulk insulation and minimising the amount of non-insulative particularly non-solar facing glazing indoor thermal radiation can also be a disadvantage with spectrally selective low-e low-emissivity glazing some insulated glazing systems can double to triple r values
in hot conditions the greatest source of heat energy is solar radiation this can enter buildings directly through windows or it can heat the building shell to a higher temperature than the ambient increasing the heat transfer through the building envelope the solar heat gain co-efficient shgc a measure of solar heat transmittance of standard single glazing can be around 78-85% solar gain can be reduced by adequate shading from the sun light coloured roofing spectrally selective heat-reflective paints and coatings and various types of insulation for the rest of the envelope specially coated glazing can reduce shgc to around 10% radiant barriers are highly effective for attic spaces in hot climates in this application they are much more effective in hot climates than cold climates for downward heat flow convection is weak and radiation dominates heat transfer across an air space radiant barriers must face an adequate air-gap to be effective
if refrigerative air-conditioning is employed in a hot humid climate then it is particularly important to seal the building envelope dehumidification of humid air infiltration can waste significant energy on the other hand some building designs are based on effective cross-ventilation instead of refrigerative air-conditioning to provide convective cooling from prevailing breezes
optimal placement of building elements eg windows doors heaters can play a significant role in insulation by considering the impact of solar radiation on the building and the prevailing breezes reflective laminates can help reduce passive solar heat in pole barns garages and metal buildings
see insulated glass for discussion of windows
the thermal envelope defines the conditioned or living space in a house the attic or basement may or may not be included in this area reducing airflow from inside to outside can help to reduce convective heat transfer significantly
ensuring low convective heat transfer also requires attention to building construction weatherization and the correct installation of insulative materials
the less natural airflow into a building the more mechanical ventilation will be required to support human comfort high humidity can be a significant issue associated with lack of airflow causing condensation rotting construction materials and encouraging microbial growth such as mould and bacteria moisture can also drastically reduce the effectiveness of insulation by creating a thermal bridge see below air exchange systems can be actively or passively incorporated to address these problems
thermal bridges are points in the building envelope that allow heat conduction to occur since heat flows through the path of least resistance thermal bridges can contribute to poor energy performance a thermal bridge is created when materials create a continuous path across a temperature difference in which the heat flow is not interrupted by thermal insulation common building materials that are poor insulators include glass and metal
a building design may have limited capacity for insulation in some areas of the structure a common construction design is based on stud walls in which thermal bridges are common in wood or steel studs and joists which are typically fastened with metal notable areas that most commonly lack sufficient insulation are the corners of buildings and areas where insulation has been removed or displaced to make room fo

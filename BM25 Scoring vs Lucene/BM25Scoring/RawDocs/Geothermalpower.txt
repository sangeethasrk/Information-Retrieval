geothermal electricity - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
geothermal electricity is electricity generated by geothermal energy technologies in use include dry steam power stations flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations geothermal electricity generation is currently used in 24 countries while geothermal heating is in use in 70 countries
as of 2015 worldwide geothermal power capacity amounts to 12.8 gigawatts gw of which 28 percent or 3,548 megawatts are installed in the united states international markets grew at an average annual rate of 5 percent over the last three years and global geothermal power capacity is expected to reach 14.5–17.6 gw by 2020 based on current geologic knowledge and technology the geothermal energy association gea estimates that only 6.5 percent of total global potential has been tapped so far while the ipcc reported geothermal power potential to be in the range of 35 gw to 2 tw countries generating more than 15 percent of their electricity from geothermal sources include el salvador kenya the philippines iceland and costa rica
geothermal power is considered to be a sustainable renewable source of energy because the heat extraction is small compared with the earth's heat content the greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are on average 45 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity or less than 5 percent of that of conventional coal-fired plants


in the 20th century demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source prince piero ginori conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 july 1904 in larderello italy it successfully lit four light bulbs later in 1911 the world's first commercial geothermal power station was built there experimental generators were built in beppu japan and the geysers california in the 1920s but italy was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958
in 1958 new zealand became the second major industrial producer of geothermal electricity when its wairakei station was commissioned wairakei was the first station to use flash steam technology
in 1960 pacific gas and electric began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power station in the united states at the geysers in california the original turbine lasted for more than 30 years and produced 11 mw net power
the binary cycle power station was first demonstrated in 1967 in russia and later introduced to the usa in 1981 following the 1970s energy crisis and significant changes in regulatory policies this technology allows the use of much lower temperature resources than were previously recoverable in 2006 a binary cycle station in chena hot springs alaska came on-line producing electricity from a record low fluid temperature of 57°c 135°f
geothermal electric stations have until recently been built exclusively where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface the development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range demonstration projects are operational in landau-pfalz germany and soultz-sous-forêts france while an earlier effort in basel switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes other demonstration projects are under construction in australia the united kingdom and the united states of america
the thermal efficiency of geothermal electric stations is low around 7–10% because geothermal fluids are at a low temperature compared with steam from boilers by the laws of thermodynamics this low temperature limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy during the generation of electricity exhaust heat is wasted unless it can be used directly and locally for example in greenhouses timber mills and district heating the efficiency of the system does not affect operational costs as it would for a coal or other fossil fuel plant but it does factor into the viability of the station in order to produce more energy than the pumps consume electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy unlike for example wind or solar its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated however the global average capacity factor was 74.5% in 2008 according to the ipcc
the earth’s heat content is about 10 joules this heat naturally flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of 44.2 terawatts tw and is replenished by radioactive decay at a rate of 30 tw these power rates are more than double humanity’s current energy consumption from primary sources but most of this power is too diffuse approximately 0.1 w m on average to be recoverable the earth's crust effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits of magma water or other to release the heat underneath
electricity generation requires high temperature resources that can only come from deep underground the heat must be carried to the surface by fluid circulation either through magma conduits hot springs hydrothermal circulation oil wells drilled water wells or a combination of these this circulation sometimes exists naturally where the crust is thin: magma conduits bring heat close to the surface and hot springs bring the heat to the surface if no hot spring is available a well must be drilled into a hot aquifer away from tectonic plate boundaries the geothermal gradient is 25–30 °c per kilometre km of depth in most of the world and wells would have to be several kilometres deep to permit electricity generation the quantity and quality of recoverable resources improves with drilling depth and proximity to tectonic plate boundaries
in ground that is hot but dry or where water pressure is inadequate injected fluid can stimulate production developers bore two holes into a candidate site and fracture the rock between them with explosives or high pressure water then they pump water or liquefied carbon dioxide down one borehole and it comes up the other borehole as a gas this approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in europe or enhanced geothermal systems in north america much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers
estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from 35 to 2000 gw depending on the scale of investments this does not include non-electric heat recovered by co-generation geothermal heat pumps and other direct use a 2006 report by the massachusetts institute of technology mit that included the potential of enhanced geothermal systems estimated that investing 1 billion us dollars in research and development over 15 years would allow the creation of 100 gw of electrical generating capacity by 2050 in the united states alone the mit report estimated that over 200 zettajoules zj would be extractable with the potential to increase this to over 2,000 zj with technology improvements – sufficient to provide all the world's present energy needs for several millennia
at present geothermal wells are rarely more than 3 kilometres 1.9 mi deep upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as 10 kilometres 6.2 mi drilling near this depth is now possible in the petroleum industry although it is an expensive process the deepest research well in the world the kola superdeep borehole is 12.3 km 7.6 mi deep this record has recently been imitated by commercial oil wells such as exxon's z-12 well in the chayvo field sakhalin wells drilled to depths greater than 4 kilometres 2.5 mi generally incur drilling costs in the tens of millions of dollars the technological challenges are to drill wide bores at low cost and to break larger volumes of rock
geothermal power is considered to be sustainable because the heat extraction is small compared to the earth's heat content but extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion although geothermal sites are capable of providing heat for many decades individual wells may cool down o

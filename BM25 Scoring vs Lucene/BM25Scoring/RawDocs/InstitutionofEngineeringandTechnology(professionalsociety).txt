institution of engineering and technology professional society - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the institution of engineering and technology iet is the largest multidisciplinary professional engineering institution in the world the iet was formed in 2006 from two separate institutions: the institution of electrical engineers iee dating back to 1871 and the institution of incorporated engineers iie dating back to 1884 its worldwide membership is currently in excess of 153,000 the iet's main offices are in savoy place in london england and at michael faraday house in stevenage england
the iet has the authority to establish professional registration for the titles of chartered engineer incorporated engineer engineering technician and ict technician as a licensed member institution of the engineering council
the iet is registered as a charity in england and wales and in scotland


discussions started in 2004 between the iee and the iie about merging to form a new institution in september 2005 both institutions held votes of the merger and the members voted in favour 73.5% iee 95.7% iie this merger also needed government approval so a petition was then made to the privy council of the united kingdom for a supplemental charter to allow the creation of the new institution this was approved by the privy council on december 14 2005 and the new institution emerged on march 31 2006
the society of telegraph engineers ste was formed on may 17 1871 and it published the journal of the society of telegraph engineers from 1872 through 1880 on december 22 1880 the ste was renamed as the society of telegraph engineers and of electricians and as part of this change it renamed its journal the journal of the society of telegraph engineers and of electricians 1881 – 82 and later the journal of the society of telegraph-engineers and electricians 1883 – 88 following a meeting of its council on 10 november 1887 it was decided to adopt the name of the institution of electrical engineers iee the name of the institution of electrical engineers remains engraved in the marble façade of its headquarters at savoy place as part of this change its journal was renamed journal of the institution of electrical engineers in 1889 and it kept this title through 1963 in 1921 the institution was incorporated by royal charter and following mergers with the institution of electronic and radio engineers iere in 1988 and the institution of manufacturing engineers imfge in 1990 it had a worldwide membership of around 120,000 the iee represented the engineering profession operated professional networks worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests had an educational role including the accreditation of degree courses and operated schemes to provide awards scholarships grants and prizes it was well known for publication of the iee wiring regulations which now continue to be written by the iet and to be published by the british standards institution as bs 7671
the iet hosts the archive for the women's engineering society wes and it has also provided office space for wes since 2005
the modern institution of incorporated engineers iie traced its heritage to the vulcanic society that was founded in 1884 and became the junior institution of engineers in 1902 which became the institution of general technician engineers in 1970 it changed its name in 1976 to the institution of mechanical and general technician engineers at this point it merged with the institution of technician engineers in mechanical engineering and formed the institution of mechanical incorporated engineers in 1988 the institution of engineers in charge which was founded in 1895 was merged into the institution of mechanical incorporated engineers imechie in 1990
the institution of electrical and electronic technician engineers the society of electronic and radio technicians and the institute of practitioners in radio and electronics merged in 1990 to form the institution of electronics and electrical incorporated engineers ieeie
the iie was formed in april 1998 by the merger of the institution of electronic and electrical incorporated engineers ieeie the institution of mechanical incorporated engineers imechie and the institute of engineers and technicians iet not to be confused with the later-formed institution of engineering and technology in 1999 there was a further merger with the institution of incorporated executive engineers iiexe the iie had a worldwide membership of approximately 40,000
the iet has a journals publishing program totalling 24 titles as of march 2012 with the addition of iet biometrics and iet networks the journals contain both original and review-oriented papers relating to various disciplines in electrical electronics computing control biomedical and communications technologies
electronics letters is a peer-reviewed rapid-communication journal which publishes short original research papers every two weeks its scope covers developments in all electronic and electrical engineering related fields also available to electronics letters subscribers are something called the insight letters
micro & nano letters first published in 2006 specialises in the rapid online publication of short research papers concentrating on advances in miniature and ultraminiature structures and systems that have at least one dimension ranging from a few tens of micrometres to a few nanometres it offers a rapid route for international dissemination of research findings generated by researchers from the micro and nano communities
the iet achievement medals are awarded to individuals who have made major and distinguished contributions in the various sectors of science engineering and technology the judging panel look for outstanding and sustained excellence in one or more activities for example: research and development innovation design manufacturing technical management and the promotion of engineering and technology
the faraday medal is a bronze medal awarded either for notable scientific or industrial achievement in engineering or for conspicuous service rendered to the advancement of science engineering and technology without restriction as regards nationality country of residence or membership of the institution it is awarded not more frequently than once a year the award was established in 1922 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first ordinary meeting of the society of telegraph engineers and is named after michael faraday
the mountbatten medal celebrates individuals who have made an outstanding contribution over a period of time to the promotion of electronics or information technology and their application contributions can be within the spheres of science technology industry or commerce and in the dissemination of the understanding of electronics and information technology whether to young people or adults the medal was founded by the national electronics council in 1992 and named after the earl mountbatten of burma the first chairman of the council
the mensforth manufacturing gold medal is awarded to candidates who have made major and distinguished contributions to advancing the manufacturing sector like the faraday medal the mensforth manufacturing gold medal is awarded without restriction regarding nationality country of residence or membership of the iet
the j j thomson medal for electronics was created in 1976 by the electronics divisional board of the institution of electrical engineers iee and is awarded to candidates who have made major and distinguished contributions in electronics
introduced in 2015 the iet volunteer medal is awarded to individuals for major and outstanding contributions voluntarily given to furthering the aims of the iet this award recognises the importance of volunteers to the iet in its mission to inspire inform and influence the global engineering community
the iet offer diamond jubilee undergraduate scholarships for first year students studying an iet accredited degree winners receive between £1,000 to £2,000 per year for up to four years to help with their studies eligibility is partially based on the exam results at the final year of school pr

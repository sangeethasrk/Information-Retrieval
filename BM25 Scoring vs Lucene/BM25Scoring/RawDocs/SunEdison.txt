sunedison - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
sunedison inc is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the us in addition to developing building owning and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants it also manufactures high purity polysilicon monocrystalline silicon ingots silicon wafers solar modules solar energy systems and solar module racking systems originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the monsanto electronic materials company a former business unit of monsanto company monsanto sold the company in 1989 prior to may 30 2013 the company was known as memc electronic materials the name change to sunedison reflects the company's focus on solar energy sunedison's corporate headquarters are in maryland heights missouri and the company's operational and solar headquarters are in belmont california with offices throughout the world
established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959 memc was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing the company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006 with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large asian solar-energy companies contracts with other solar-energy companies followed as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants with the acquisition of the large successful and pioneering solar-energy systems company sunedison llc in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies axio and fotowatio in 2011 memc focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market the company now develops finances and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial public-sector and power-plant customer base and its name change in 2013 to sunedison inc reflects its main focus it is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide and with its acquisition of wind-energy company first wind in 2014 sunedison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world sunedison's subsidiaries terraform power and terraform global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe in 2015 sunedison sold off its subsidiary sunedison semiconductor which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry the divestiture marked the completion of sunedison inc's transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation


the establishment of monsanto electronic materials company memc a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry was announced on august 6 1959 as an arm of the us-based multinational corporation monsanto in february 1960 memc started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in st peters missouri 30 miles west of monsanto's headquarters in st louis as one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers memc was a pioneer in the field and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century memc used the czochralski process cz process of silicon crystal production and developed the chemical mechanical polishing cmp process of wafer finishing in 1966 memc installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible
in the early 1970s memc opened a production plant in kuala lumpur malaysia and sent its st peters–produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing in 1979 memc became the first company to manufacture 125mm 5-inch wafers in 1981 the first to produce 150mm 6-inch wafers and in partnership with ibm in 1984 the first to produce 200mm 8-inch wafers in 1986 memc opened its production and r&d facility in utsunomiya japan to serve the japanese semiconductor market becoming the first non-japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in japan
memc experienced heavy price-pressure from japanese competition during the mid 1980s despite its success and increasing revenues memc had to account for losses for a few years leading to the decision of monsanto which was refocusing on chemicals agriculture and biotechnology products to sell the electronic materials division in 1989 the german company hüls ag the chemicals arm of the german conglomerate veba acquired monsanto electronic materials and combined it with hüls' previous acquisition dynamite nobel silicon dns to form memc electronic materials dns already operated silicon wafer plants in merano and novara italy and integrated them within the new memc electronic materials hüls supported the new subsidiary with $50 million for research and development and for manufacturing expansion in 1991 memc developed the first process using granular polysilicon which provided cost and productivity advantages over chunk polysilicon four years later memc acquired albemarle corporation's granular polysilicon production facility in pasadena texas which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987
memc's stock began trading on the new york stock exchange with an initial public offering in 1995 the ipo raised over $400 million which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company and hüls veba retained a majority interest in the company
the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit memc hard in 1998 the company reported a loss of $316 million on revenues of $759 million in june 2000 veba ag still holding 72% of memc was merged with viag to form the new eon ag eon wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities and assigned merrill lynch to sell memc merrill was unable to find a buyer until memc announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001 finally in october 2001 eon was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company texas pacific group tpg which purchased eon's stake in memc for a symbolic dollar and offered memc $150 million in credit lines tpg restructured memc's debt increased its stake in the company to 90% and cut one third of its workforce
memc returned to profitability following the appointment of nabeel gareeb who was ceo of memc from april 2002 to november 2008 memc's market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures memc's sales topped $1 billion in 2004 and it was number three in market share through a secondary offering tpg reduced its share of memc in 2005 to 34% and by the end of 2007 to zero
in 2006 memc announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market via longterm agreements to supply china-based suntech power and taiwan-based gintech energy with solar-grade silicon wafers similar contracts followed with germany-based conergy in 2007 and taiwan-based tainergy tech in 2008 the company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well by 2007 memc held approximately 14% of the solar wafer market having returned memc to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market ceo nabeel gareeb resigned in november 2008 ahmad chatila was appointed president and ceo in february 2009
in july 2009 memc and q-cells which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants formed a joint venture to build strasskirchen solar park a 50 mw photovoltaic plant in bavaria germany with memc supplying the solar wafers and q-cells converting them into solar cells both partners invested $100 million each in return for a 50%-each ownership of the project as planned the plant was sold to an investment firm nordcapital after operations started at the beginning of 2010
in november 2009 memc acquired the privately owned company sunedison llc north america's largest solar energy services provider founded by jigar shah sunedison had been developing financing building operating and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers including many national retail outlets government agencies and utilities since 2003 the company had pioneered solar-as-a-service and the solar power purchase agreement ppa for no-money-down customer financin

mallory park - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
mallory park is a motor racing circuit situated in the village of kirkby mallory just off the a47 between leicester and hinckley in central england originally used for grass-track until 1955 a new basically oval hard-surfaced course was constructed for 1956 with a later extension forming a loop with a hairpin bend
with the car circuit measuring only 1.35 miles 2.173 km it is amongst the shortest permanent race circuits in the uk however chicanes introduced to reduce speeds in motorcycle events mean that the superbike circuit is now slightly longer at 1.41 miles 2.269 km shorter uk circuits are lydden hill brands hatch indy circuit scotland's knockhill and silverstone's diminutive stowe circuit


the circuit has a number of formations founded on a basic one-mile oval with the majority of configurations including the northerly extension to the tight 180° shaw's hairpin at the other end of the circuit lies the long right-hand gerard's bend gerard's is about a third of a mile long and turns through nearly 200° it was named after local racing hero bob gerard who opened the newly reconstructed circuit on 25 april 1956 unusually there are a number of large lakes occupying approximately half of the circuit infield despite its short length and shaw's hairpin the tightest corner of any uk track other than the hairpin on cadwell park's short circuit mallory is a fast circuit to reduce speeds for motorcycle racing a pair of chicanes have been introduced together with a revised exit to gerard's edwina's was added toward the end of the straight following gerard's named after former managing director of the circuit edwina overend and the bus stop chicane on the descent to the sweeping left kink the devil's elbow a blind downhill off camber left-hander before the start–finish line on kirkby straight in 2003 a new complex was added toward the end of gerard's curve this sequence of bends was designed to reduce speeds on entry to edwina's and to prevent motorcycles from colliding as they jockey for position into the chicane
mallory park does not have any true permanent garage facilities although there are a handful of open garages in the pitlane

food miles - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
food miles is a term which refers to the distance food is transported from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer food miles are one factor used when assessing the environmental impact of food including the impact on global warming
the concept of food miles originated in the early 1990s in the united kingdom it was conceived by professor tim lang at the sustainable agriculture food and environment safe alliance and first appeared in print in a report “the food miles report: the dangers of long-distance food transport” researched and written by angela paxton
some scholars believe that an increase in the miles food travels is due to the globalization of trade the focus of food supply bases into fewer larger districts drastic changes in delivery patterns the increase in processed and packaged foods and making fewer trips to the supermarket at the same time most of the greenhouse gas emissions created by food have their origin in the production phases which create 83% of overall emissions of co2
a range of studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle including production consumption and transport these include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate' in the uk for example agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain including retail packaging fertilizer manufacture and other factors whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions the goal of environmental protection agencies is to make people aware of the environmental impact of food miles and to show the pollution percentage and the energy used to transport food over long distances  researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information
the concept of food miles has been criticised and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production


the concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of sustainability which deals with a large range of environmental social and economic issues including local food the term was coined by tim lang now professor of food policy city university london who says: the point was to highlight the hidden ecological social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way one which had objective reality but also connotations food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions
although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact for example a defra report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at aea technology environment entitled the validity of food miles as an indicator of sustainable development included findings that the direct environmental social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year and are dominated by congestion the report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling more emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place also the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation unless it is produced by local farms the carbon trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered including production origin seasonality and home care
a recent study led by professor miguel gomez applied economics and management at cornell university and supported by the atkinson center for a sustainable future found that in many instances the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets it suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets
with processed foods that are made of many different ingredients it is very complicated though not impossible to calculate the co2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport air road or rail however as both prof lang and the original food miles report noted the resulting number – although interesting cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable – or not – a food product is
according to oxfam researchers there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food supply chain that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions which are not taken into account by simple food miles measurements there are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets
however exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people unless the product has a fairtrade label or a label from another robust and independent scheme food exports might make a bad situation worse for example wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption so local people can go hungry
researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what energy is used in its production a recent defra case study indicated that tomatoes grown in spain and transported to the united kingdom may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of energy efficiency than tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in the united kingdom
according to german researchers the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account using the methodology of life cycle assessment lca in accordance to iso 14040 entire supply chains to provide german consumers with food were investigated comparing local food with food of european and global provenance as a matter of fact an increasing size of transportation and production units leads to decreasing energy use per kilogram food research reports from the chair of process engineering in food and service business prof dr-ing elmar h schlich at justus liebig university giessen germany define and establish the term and theory of ecologies of scale by analogy to the well-known term of economies of scale in terms of energy use per kilogram small food production units may cause even more environmental impact compared to bigger units even if the food miles are lower case studies of lamb meat beef bottled wine apples fruit juices and pork meat gave evidence to this and disproved the food miles concept as too simple
a 2006 research report from the agribusiness and economics research unit at lincoln university new zealand counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in food production in europe and new zealand taking into account energy used to ship the food to europe for consumers the report states new zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the uk for example new zealand agriculture tends to apply fewer fertilizers which require large am

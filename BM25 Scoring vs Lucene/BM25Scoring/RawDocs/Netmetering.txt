net energy metering - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
net energy metering nem or simply net metering allows consumers which generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity anytime instead of when it is generated this is particularly important with wind and solar which are non-dispatchable monthly net metering allows consumers to use solar power generated during the day at night or wind from a windy day later in the month annual net metering rolls over a net kilowatt credit to the following month allowing solar power that was generated in july to be used in december or wind power from march in august
net metering policies can vary significantly by country and by state or province: if net metering is available if and how long you can keep your banked credits and how much the credits are worth retail wholesale most net metering laws involve monthly roll over of kwh credits a small monthly connection fee require monthly payment of deficits ie normal electric bill and annual settlement of any residual credit unlike a feed-in tariff fit which requires two meters net metering uses a single bi-directional meter and can measure current flowing in two directions net metering can be implemented solely as an accounting procedure and requires no special metering or even any prior arrangement or notification
net metering is an enabling policy designed to foster private investment in renewable energy


net metering originated in the united states where small wind turbines and solar panels were connected to the electrical grid and consumers wanted to be able to use the electricity generated at a different time or date than when it was generated minnesota is commonly cited as passing the first net metering law in 1983 and allowed anyone generating less than 40 kw to either roll over any kilowatt credit to the next month or be paid for the excess in 2000 this was amended to compensation at the average retail utility energy rate this is the simplest and most general interpretation of net metering and in addition allows small producers to sell electricity at the retail rate
utilities in idaho adopted net metering in 1980 and in arizona in 1981 massachusetts adopted net metering in 1982 by 1998 22 states or utilities therein had adopted net metering two california utilities initially adopted a monthly net metering charge which included a standby charge until the puc banned such charges in 2005 all us utilities were required to offer net metering upon request excess generation is not addressed as of 2016 43 us states have adopted net metering as well as utilities in 3 of the remaining states leaving only 4 states without any established procedures for implementing net metering
net metering was slow to be adopted in europe especially in the united kingdom because of confusion over how to address the value added tax vat only one utility company in great britain offers net metering
the united kingdom government is reluctant to introduce the net metering principle because of complications in paying and refunding the value added tax that is payable on electricity but pilot projects are underway in some areas
in canada some provinces have net metering programs
in the philippines net metering scheme is governed by republic act 9513 renewable energy act of 2008 and it's implementing rules and regulation irr the implementing body is the energy regulatory commission erc in consultation with the national renewable energy board nreb unfortunately the scheme is not a true net metering scheme but in reality a net billing scheme as the dept of energy's net metering guidelines say 
“net-metering allows customers of distribution utilities dus to install an on-site renewable energy re facility not exceeding 100 kilowatts kw in capacity so they can generate electricity for their own use any electricity generated that is not consumed by the customer is automatically exported to the du’s distribution system the du then gives a peso credit for the excess electricity received equivalent to the du’s blended generation cost excluding other generation adjustments and deducts the credits earned to the customer’s electric bill”
thus philippine consumers who generate their own electricity and sell their surplus to the utility are paid what is called the generation cost which is often less than 50% of the retail price of electricity
net metering is controversial as it affects different interests on the grid a report prepared by peter kind of energy infrastructure advocates for the trade association edison electric institute stated that distributed generation systems like rooftop solar present unique challenges to the future of electric utilities
renewable advocates point out that while distributed solar and other energy efficiency measures do pose a challenge to electric utilities' existing business model the benefits of distributed generation outweigh the costs and those benefits are shared by all ratepayers grid benefits of private distributed solar investment include reduced need for centralizing power plants and reduced strain on the utility grid they also point out that as a cornerstone policy enabling the growth of rooftop solar net metering creates a host of societal benefits for all ratepayers that are generally not accounted for by the utility analysis including: public health benefits employment and downstream economic effects market price impacts grid security benefits and water savings
an independent report conducted by the consulting firm crossborder energy found that the benefits of california's net metering program outweigh the costs to ratepayers those net benefits will amount to more than us$92 million annually upon the completion of the current net metering program
a 2012 report on the cost of net metering in the state of california commissioned by the california public utilities commission cpuc showed that those customers without distributed generation systems will pay us$287 in additional costs to use and maintain the grid every year by 2020 the report also showed the net cost will amount to us$1.1 billion by 2020 notably the same report found that solar customers do pay more on their power bills than what it costs the utility to serve them table 5 page 10: average 103% of their cost of service across the three major utilities in 2011
many electric utilities state that owners of generation systems do not pay the full cost of service to use the grid thus shifting their share of the cost on to customers without distributed generation systems most owners of rooftop solar or other types of distributed generation systems still rely on the grid to receive electricity from utilities at night or when their systems cannot generate sufficient power
a 2014 report funded by the institute for electric innovation reveals that net metering in california produces excessively large subsidies for typical residential rooftop solar pv facilities these subsidies must then be paid for by other residential customers most of whom are less affluent than the rooftop solar pv customers in addition the report points out that most of these large subsidies go to the solar leasing companies which accounted for about 75 percent of the solar pv facilities installed in 2013 the report concludes that changes are needed in california ranging from the adoption of retail tariffs that are more cost-reflective to replacing net metering with a separate buy all - sell all arrangement that requires all rooftop solar pv customers to buy all of their consumed energy under the existing retail tariffs and separately sell all of their onsite generation to their distribution utilities at the utilities' respective avoided costs
there is considerable confusion between the terms net metering and feed-in tariff in general there are three types of compensation for local distributed generation:
net metering only requires one meter a feed-in tariff requires two
time of use tou net metering employs a specialized reversible smart electric meter that is programmed to determine electricity usage any time during the day time-of-use allows utility rates and charges to be assessed based on when the electricity was used ie day night and seasonal rates typically the generation cost of electricity is highest during the daytime peak usage period and lowest at night time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable-energy sources since for example solar power systems tend to produce energy during the daytime peak-price period and produce little or no power during the night period when price is low italy has installed so many photovoltaic cells that peak prices no longer are during the day but are instead in the evening tou net metering affects the apparent cost of net metering to a utility
in market rate net metering systems the user's energy use is priced dynamically according to some function of wholesale electric prices the users' meters are programmed remotely to calculate the value and are read remotely net metering applies such variable pricing to excess power produced by a qualifying system
market rate metering systems were implemented in california starting in 2006 and under the terms of california's net metering rules will be applicable to qualifying photovoltaic and wind systems under california law the payback for surplus electricity sent to the grid must be equal to the variable in this case price charged at that time
net metering enables small systems to result in zero annual net cost to the consumer provided that the consumer is able to shift demand loads to a lower price time such as by chilling water at a low cost time for later use in air conditioning or by charging a battery electric vehicle during off-peak times while the electricity generated at peak demand time can be sent to the grid rather than used locally see vehicle-to-grid no credit is given for annual surplus production
excess generation is a separate issue from net metering but it is normally dealt with in the same rules because it can arise if local generation offsets a portion of the demand net metering is not used if local generation exceeds demand some of the time for example during the day net metering is used if local generation exceeds demand for the billing cycle best practices calls for a perpetual roll over of the kilowatt credits although some regions have considered having any kilowatt credits expire after 36 months the normal definition of excess generation is annually although the term is equally applicable monthly the treatment of annual excess generation and monthly ranges from lost to compensation at avoided cost to compensation at retail rate left over kilowatt credits upon termination of service would ideally be paid at retail rate from the consumer standpoint and lost from the utility standpoint with avoided cost a minimum compromise some regions allow optional payment for excess annual generation which allows perpetual roll over or payment at the customers choice both wind and solar are inherently seasonal and it is highly likely to use up a surplus later unless more solar panels or a larger wind turbine have been installed than needed
net metering systems can have energy storage integrated to store some of the power locally ie from the renewable energy source connected to the system rather than selling everything back to the mains electricity grid often the batteries used are industrial deep cycle batteries as these last for 10 to 20 years lead-acid batteries are often also still used but last much less long 5 years or so lithium-ion batteries are sometimes also used but too have a relatively short lifespan finally nickel-iron batteries last the longest with a lifespan of up to 40 years
in some australian states the feed-in tariff is actually net metering except that it pays monthly for net generation at a higher rate than retail with environment victoria campaigns director mark wakeham calling it a fake feed-in tariff a feed-in tariff requires a separate meter and pays for all local generation at a preferential rate while net metering requires only one meter the financial differences are very substantial
in victoria from 2009 householders were paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid this was around three times the retail price for electricity at that time however subsequent state governments reduced the feed-in in several updates until in 2016 the feed-in is as low as 5 cents per kilowatt hour
in queensland starting in 2008 the solar bonus scheme pays 44 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid this is around three times the current retail price for electricity however from 2012 the queensland feed in tariff has been reduced to 6-10 cents per kilowatt hour depending on which electricity retailer the customer has signed up with
ontario allows net metering for up to 500 kw however credits can only be carried for 12 consecutive months should a consumer establish a credit where they generate more than they consume for 8 months and use up the credits in the 10th month then the 12-month period begins again from the date that the next credit is shown on an invoice any unused credits remaining at the end of 12 consecutive months of a consumer being in a credit situation are cleared at the end of that billing
areas of british columbia serviced by bc hydro are allowed net metering for up to 50 kw at each annual anniversary the customer was paid 8.16 cents per kwh if there is a net export of power after each 12-month period which was increased to 9.99 cents kwh effective june 1 2012 systems over 50 kw are covered under the standing offer program fortisbc which serves an area in south central bc also allows net-metering for up to 50 kw customers are paid their existing retail rate for any net energy they produce the city of new westminster which has its own electrical utility does not currently allow net metering
new brunswick allows net metering for installations up to 100 kw credits from excess generated power can be carried over until march at which time any excess credits are lost
saskpower allows net metering for installations up to 100 kw credits from excess generated power can be carried over until the customer's annual anniversary date at which time any excess credits are lost
denmark established net-metering for privately owned pv systems in mid-1998 for a pilot-period of four years in 2002 the net-metering scheme was extended another four years up to end of 2006 net-metering has proved to be a cheap easy to administer and effective way of stimulating the deployment of pv in denmark however the relative short time window of the arrangement has so far prevented it from reaching its full potential during the political negotiations in the fall of 2005 the net-metering for privately owned pv systems was made permanent
italy offers a support scheme mixing net-metering and a well segmented premium fit
in 2010 spain net-metering has been proposed by the asociación de la industria fotovoltaica asif to promote renewable electricity without requiring additional economic support but net-metering for privately owned systems is not yet established
some form of net metering is now proposed by électricité de france according to their website energy produced by home-owners is bought at a higher price than what is charged as consumers hence some recommend to sell all energy produced and buy back all energy needed at a lower price the price has been fixed for 20 years by the government
net metering was pioneered in the united states as a way to allow solar and wind to provide electricity whenever available and allow use of that electricity whenever it was needed beginning with utilities in idaho in 1980 and in arizona in 1981 in 1983 minnesota passed the first state net metering law as of march 2015 44 states and washington dc have developed mandatory net metering rules for at least some utilities
net metering policies are determined by states which have set policies varying on a number of key dimensions the energy policy act of 2005 required state electricity regulators to consider but not necessarily implement rules that mandate public electric utilities make available upon request net metering to their customers several legislative bills have been prop

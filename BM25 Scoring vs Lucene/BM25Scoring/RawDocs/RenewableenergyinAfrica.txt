renewable energy in africa - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
the developing nations of africa are popular locations for the application of renewable energy technology currently many nations already have small-scale solar wind and geothermal devices in operation providing energy to urban and rural populations these types of energy production are especially useful in remote locations because of the excessive cost of transporting electricity from large-scale power plants the application of renewable energy technology has the potential to alleviate many of the problems that face africans every day especially if done so in a sustainable manner that prioritizes human rights
access to energy is essential for the reduction of poverty and promotion of economic growth communication technologies education industrialization agricultural improvement and expansion of municipal water systems all require abundant reliable and cost-effective energy access


by investing in the long term energy solutions that alternative energy sources afford most african nations would benefit significantly in the longer term by avoiding the pending economic problems developed countries are currently facing
although in many ways fossil fuels provide a simple easy to use energy source that powered the industrialization of most modern nations the issues associated with the widespread use of fossil fuels are now numerous consisting of some of the world's most difficult and large scale global political economic health and environmental problems the looming energy crisis results from consuming these fossil fuels at a rate which is unsustainable with the global demand for fossil fuels expected to increase every year for the next several decades compounding existing problems
while a great number of projects are currently underway to expand and connect the existing grid networks too many problems exist to make this a realistic option for the vast majority of people in africa especially those who live in rural locations distributed generation using renewable energy systems is the only practical solution to meet rural electrification needs
hydro-electric wind and solar power all derive their energy from the sun the sun emits more energy in one second 3.827 × 10 j than is available in all of the fossil fuels present on earth 3.9 × 10 j and therefore has the potential to provide all of our current and future global energy requirements since the solar source for renewable energy is clean and free african nations can protect their people their environment and their future economic development by using renewable energy sources to this end they have a number of possible options
africa is the sunniest continent on earth especially as there are many perpertually sunny areas like the huge sahara desert it has much greater solar resources than any other continent desert regions stand up as the most sunshiny while rainforests are considerably cloudier but still get a good global solar irradiation because of the proximity with the equator
the distribution of solar resources across africa is fairly uniform with more than 85% of the continent's landscape receiving at least 2,000 kwh m² year a recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising north africa could supply all of the energy required by the european union
africa has a large coastline where wind power and wave power resources are abundant and underutilized in the north and south geothermal power has potential to provide considerable amounts of energy in many eastern african nations
wind is far less uniformly distributed than solar resources with optimal locations positioned near special topographical funnelling features close to coastal locations mountain ranges and other natural channels in the north and south the availability of wind on the western coast of africa is substantial exceeding 3,750 kw·h and will accommodate the future prospect for energy demands central africa has lower than average wind resources to work with
geothermal power is mostly concentrated in eastern africa but there are many fragmented spots of high intensity geothermal potential spread across the continent there is enormous potential for geothermal energy in the east african rift which is roughly 3,700 miles in length and spans several countries in east africa including eritrea ethiopia djibouti kenya uganda and zambia
the use of biomass fuels endangers biodiversity and risks further damaged or destruction to the landscape 86% of africa’s biomass energy is used in the sub-saharan region excluding south africa even where other forms of energy are available it is not harnessed and utilized efficiently underscoring the need to promote energy efficiency where energy access is available
there is however an urgent need to address the current levels of respiratory illness from burning biomass in the home taking into respect the cost differential between the biomass and fossil fuels it is far more cost-effective to improve the technology used to burn the biomass than to use fossil fuels
solar and wind power are extremely scalable as there are systems available from less than 1 watt to several megawatts this makes it possible to initialize the electrification of a home or village with minimal initial capital it also allows for dynamic and incremental scaling as load demands increases the component configuration of a wind or solar installation also provides a level of functional redundancy improving the reliability of the system if a single panel in a multi panel solar array is damaged the rest of the system continues functioning unimpeded in a similar way the failure of a single wind tower in a multi tower configuration does not cause a system level failure
because solar and wind projects produce power where it is used they provide a safe reliable and cost effective solution because transmission equipment is avoided these systems are more secure and less vulnerable to attack this can be an important feature in regions prone to conflict wind and solar power systems are simple to set up easy to operate easy to repair and durable wind resources and solar resource are abundant enough to provide all of the electrical energy requirements of rural populations and this can be done in remote and otherwise fragmented low density areas that are impractical to address using conventional grid based systems
photo-voltaic panels wind turbines deep cycle batteries meters sockets cables and connectors are all expensive even when the relative difference in buying power materials cost opportunity cost labor cost and overhead are factored in renewable energy will remain expensive for people who are living on less than us$1 per day many rural electrification projects in the past use government subsidies to finance the implementation of rural development programs it is difficult for rural electrification projects to be accomplished by for profit companies in economically impoverished areas these programs must be run at a loss for reasons of practicality there are several theorized ways in which specific african nations can rally the resources for such projects
european countries that consume oil refined from african countries have the opportunity to subsidize the costs of individual level village level or community level alternative energy systems through emissions trading credits it has been proposed that for every unit of african origin carbon consumed by the european market a predetermined amount green credits or carbon credits would be yielded the european partners could then either supply parts components or systems directly an equivalent amount of investment capital or lend credits to finance the distribution of renewable energy services knowledge or equipment
international relief targeted at poverty reduction could also be redirected towards subsidizing renewable energy projects because of the integral role that electrification plays in supporting economic and social development funding of rural electrification can be seen as core method for addressing poverty radios televisions telephones computer networks and computers all rely on an access to electricity because information services allow for the proliferation of education resources funding the electric backbone to such systems has derivative effect on their development in this way access to communications and education plays a major role in reducing poverty additionally international efforts that supplies equipment and services rather than money are more resistant to resource misappropriation issue that pose problems in less stable governments
unep has developed a loan programme to stimulate renewable energy market forces with attractive return rates buffer initial deployment costs and entice consumers to consider and purchase renewable technology after a successful solar loan program sponsored by unep that helped 100,000 people finance solar power systems in developing countries like india unep started similar schemes in other parts of developing world like africa - tunisia morocco kenya projects are already functional and many projects in other african nations are in the pipeline in africa unep assistance to ghana kenya and namibia has resulted in the adoption of draft national climate awareness plans publications in local languages radio programmes and seminars the rural energy enterprise development reed initiative is another flagship unep effort focused on enterprise development and seed financing for clean energy entrepreneurs in developing countries of west and southern africa
the government of south africa has set up the south african renewables initiative sari to develop a financing arrangement that would enable a critical mass of renewables to be developed in south africa through a combination of international loans and grants as well as domestic funding this has been a highly successful programme now known as the reippp renewable energy independent power producer programme with four rounds of allocations already completed in round 1 19 projects were allocated in round 2 28 projects were allocated in round 3 17 projects were allocated and in round 4 26 projects were allocated over 6100mw has been allocated with a total of r194 billion us$16 billion being invested in this programme it is important to note that this investment figure represents full funding from private entities and banks - there are no government subsidies for this programme
the funding of renewable energy re projects is dependent on the credibility of the institutions developing and implementing re policy this places a particular burden on the energy regulators in africa—whose professional staff may be few in number and who have track records of only a decade or so rules micro policies made by regulators are subsidiary to overall government re policy and depend on some delegation of authority from the state nevertheless there are instances when the sector regulator can pro-active on behalf of customer and utility concerns—providing facts reports and public statements that build a case for care in the design of public policy towards re clean and renewable energy is likely to be of concern to a number of organizations interaction between multiple authorities requires coordination to align policies incentives and administrative processes including licensing and permitting of course the making of policy by regulators is incidental to and inherent in their duty to decide specific cases or disputes this micro policy making role is derived from the fact that macro re policy cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all aspects of policy that will have to evolve for the regulatory process to be fully functional this point is particularly important in the area of renewable energy with its rapidly changing technologies and ever-changing public and political attitudes gaps will have to be filled and it is the regulators with their functional responsibilities technical expertise and hands-on experience that are best positioned to accomplish that task in developing countries thus for designing auctions for purchased power for establishing feed-in tariffs or other instruments promoting re the energy sector regulator has a significant impact on the penetration of re in africa and other regions
several large-scale solar power facilities are under development in africa including projects in south africa and algeria although solar power technology has the potential to supply energy to large numbers of people and has been used to generate power on a large scale in developed nations its greatest potential in africa may be to provide power on a smaller scale and to use this energy to help with day-to-day needs such as small-scale electrification desalination water pumping and water purification
the first utility-scale solar farm in sub-saharan africa is the 8.5mw plant at agahozo-shalom youth village in the rwamagana district eastern province of rwanda it leased 20 hectares 49 acres of land from the village which is a charity to house and educate rwandan genocide victims the plant uses 28,360 photovoltaic panels and produces 6% of total electrical supply of the country the project was built with us israeli dutch norwegian finnish and uk funding and expertise
there are several examples of small grid-linked solar power stations in africa including the photovoltaic 250 kw kigali solaire station in rwanda under the south africa renewable energy independent power producer procurement program several projects have been developed including the 96mwdc jasper solar energy project the 75mwdc lesedi pv project and the 75mwdc letsatsi pv project all developed by the american company solarreserve and completed in 2014
power up gambia a non-profit operating in the gambia uses solar power technology to provide power to gambian health care facilities providing a reliable source of electricity for lighting diagnostic testing treatments and water pumping energy for opportunity efo a non-profit working in west africa uses solar power for schools health clinics and community charging stations as well as teaches photovoltaic installation classes at local technical institutes so far its work has been mainly in sierra leone in particular its solar powered community charging stations have been recognized as an innovative model to provide electricity to rural communities in the region
some plans exist to build solar farms in the deserts of north africa to supply power for europe the desertec project backed by several european energy companies and banks planned to generate renewable electricity in the sahara desert and distribute it through a high-voltage grid for export to europe and local consumption in north-africa ambitions seek to provide continental europe with up to 15% of its electricity the tunur project would supply 2gw of solar generated electricity from tunisia to the uk
one of the most immediate and lethal problems facing many third world countries is the availability of clean drinking water solar powered technologies can help alleviate this problem with minimal cost using a combination of solar powered well pumping a water tower or other holding tank and a solar powered water purifier these technologies require minimal maintenance have low operational costs and once set up will help provide clean water for drinking and agriculture with large enough reservoirs for the water that has been pumped and purified with solar powered technology a community will be better able to withstand drought or famine this reservoir water could be consumed by humans livestock or used to irrigate community gardens and fields thus improving crop yields and community health a solar powered water purification system can be used to clean many pathogens and germs from groundwater and runoff a group of these devices filtering the water from wells or runoff could help with poor sanitation and controlling the spread of waterborne illnesses
kenya may be a good candidate for testing out these systems because of its progressive and relatively well-funded department of agriculture including the kenya agricultural research center 5 which provides funding and oversight to many projects investigating experimental methods and technologies
even though this solar technology may have a higher starting cost

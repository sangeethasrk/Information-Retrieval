ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the new seeds and plants a clerk to collect agricultural statistics statewide reports about crops in different regions and the application of chemistry to agriculture ellsworth was called the father of the department of agriculture
in 1849 the patent office was transferred to the newly created department of the interior in the ensuing years agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring
on may 15 1862 abraham lincoln established the independent department of agriculture to be headed by a commissioner without cabinet status and the agriculturalist isaac newton was appointed to be the first such commissioner lincoln called it the people's department in the 1880s varied advocacy groups were lobbying for cabinet representation business interests sought a department of commerce and industry and farmers tried to raise the department of agriculture to cabinet rank in 1887 the house of representatives and senate passed bills giving cabinet status to the department of agriculture and labor but the bill was defeated in conference committee after farm interests objected to the addition of labor finally on february 9 1889 president grover cleveland signed a bill into law elevating the department of agriculture to cabinet level

during the great depression farming remained a common way of life for millions of americans the department of agriculture was crucial to providing concerned persons with the assistance that they needed to make it through this difficult period helping to ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it assisting with loans for small landowners and contributing to the education of the rural youth
today many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of america and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run and operated under the usda food and nutrition service activities in this program include the supplemental nutrition assistance program which provides healthy food to over 40 million low-income and homeless people each month usda is a member of the united states interagency council on homelessness where it is committed to working with other agencies to ensure these mainstream benefits are accessed by those experiencing homelessness
the usda also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets it plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries this aid can go through usaid foreign governments international bodies such as world food program or approved nonprofits the agricultural act of 1949 section 416 b and agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 also known as food for peace provides the legal basis of such actions the usda is a partner of the world cocoa foundation
allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history that its personnel have discriminated against african-american farmers denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s the effect of this discrimination has been the reduction in the number of african-american farmers in the united states in 1999 the usda settled a class action lawsuit the pigford case alleging discrimination against african-american farmers in the late twentieth century the government's settlement of nearly $1 billion with more than 13,300 farmers was reportedly the largest civil rights claim to date the 2008 farm bill provided for additional farmers to have their claims heard as 70,000 had filed late in the original program in 2010 the federal government made another $1.2 billion settlement in what is called pigford ii for outstanding claims
many black farmers across the nation experienced discrimination in their dealings with in-state usda agencies across the nation black farmers alleged and the usda later agreed they were denied access to loans and subsidies provided by the government on a national level farm subsidies that were afforded to white farmers were not afforded to black farmers since they were denied government loans emergency or disaster assistance and other aid many black farmers lost their farms and homes
following long-standing concerns black farmers joined a class action discrimination suit against the usda filed in federal court in 1997 an attorney called it the most organized largest civil rights case in the history of the country
also in 1997 black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the usda headquarters in washington dc protests in front of the usda were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers representatives of the national black farmers association met with president bill clinton and other administration officials at the white house and nbfa's president testified before the united states house committee on agriculture

the nbfa's president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement including before the united states senate committee on agriculture on september 12 2000 when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement nbfa asked congress to pass legislation that would ensure a full resolution of the discrimination cases

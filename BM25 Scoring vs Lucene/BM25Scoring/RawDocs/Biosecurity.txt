biosecurity - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
biosecurity has multiple meanings and is defined differently according to various disciplines the original definition of biosecurity started out as a set of preventive measures designed to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in crops and livestock quarantined pests invasive alien species and living modified organisms koblentz 2010 the term was first used by the agricultural and environmental communities starting from the late 1990s in response to the threat of biological terrorism biosecurity encompasses the prevention of the intentional removal theft of biological materials from research laboratories these preventative measures are a combination of systems and practices put into its place at bioscience laboratories to prevent the use of dangerous pathogens and toxins for malicious use as well as by customs agents and agricultural and natural resource managers to prevent the spread of these biological agents
advances in technology have meant that many civilian research projects in medicine have the potential to be used in military applications dual-use research and biosecurity protocols are used to prevent dangerous biological materials from falling into the hands of malevolent parties the national academies of science define biosecurity as security against the inadvertent inappropriate or intentional malicious or malevolent use of potentially dangerous biological agents or biotechnology including the development production stockpiling or use of biological weapons as well as outbreaks of newly emergent and epidemic disease biosecurity requires the cooperation of scientists technicians policy makers security engineers and law enforcement officials


initially health security or biosecurity issues have not been considered as an international security issue especially in the traditional view of international relations however some changes in trend have contributed to inclusion of biosecurity health security in discussions of security koblentz 2010 as time progressed there was a movement towards securitization non-traditional security issues such as climate change organized crime terrorism and landmines came to be included in the definition of international security koblentz 2010 there was a general realization that the actors in the international system not only involved nation-states but also included international organizations institutions and individuals koblentz 2010 therefore ensuring the security of various actors within each nation became an important agenda biosecurity is one of the issues to be securitized under this trend in fact in january 10 2000 the un security council convened to discuss hiv aids as a security issue in africa and designated it a threat in the following month the undp millennium development goals also recognize health issues as international security issue koblentz 2010 several instances of epidemics that followed such as sars increased awareness of health security biosecurity recently several factors have rendered biosecurity issues more severe there is a continuing advancement of biotechnology which increases the possibility for malevolent use evolution of infectious diseases and globalizing force which is making the world more interdependent and more susceptible to spread of epidemics koblentz 2010
some uncertainties about the policy implementation for biosecurity remain for future in order to carefully plan out preventative policies policy makers need to be able to somewhat predict the probability and assess the risks however as the uncertain nature of the biosecurity issue goes it is largely difficult to predict and also involves a complex process as it requires a multidisciplinary approachkoblentz 2010 the policy choices they make to address an immediate threat could pose another threat in the future facing an unintended trade-off policy makers are also constantly looking for a more effective way to coordinate international actors- governmental organizations and ngos- and actors from different nations so that they could tackle the problem of resource overlap koblentz 2010
components of a laboratory biosecurity program include:
animal biosecurity is the product of all actions undertaken by an entity to prevent introduction of disease agents into a specific area animal biosecurity differs from biosecurity which are measures taken to reduce the risk of infectious agent theft and dispersal by means of bioterrorism animal biosecurity is a comprehensive approach encompassing different means of prevention and containment a critical element in animal biosecurity biocontainment is the control of disease agents already present in a particular area and works to prevent novel transmissions animal biosecurity may protect organisms from infectious agents or noninfectious agents such as toxins or pollutants and can be executed in areas as large as a nation or as small as a local farm
animal biosecurity takes into account the epidemiological triad for disease occurrence: the individual host the disease and the environment in contributing to disease susceptibility it aims to improve nonspecific immunity of the host to resist the introduction of an agent or limit the risk that an agent will be sustained in an environment at adequate levels biocontainment an element of animal biosecurity works to improve specific immunity towards already present pathogens
biosecurity means the prevention of the illicit use of pathogenic bioorganisms by laboratory staff or others biosafety means the protection of laboratory staff from being infected by pathogenic bioorganisms
the destruction of the world trade center in manhattan on september 11 2001 by terrorists and subsequent wave of anthrax attacks on us media and government outlets both real and hoax led to increased attention on the risk of bioterror attacks in the united states proposals for serious structural reforms national and or regional border controls and a single co-ordinated system of biohazard response abounded
one of the major challenges in biosecurity is the increasing availability and accessibility of potentially harmful technology biomedical advances and the globalization of scientific and technical expertise have made it possible to greatly improve public health however there is also the risk that advances can lead to make biological weapons
the proliferation of high biosafety level laboratories around the world has many experts worried about availability of targets for those that might be interested in stealing dangerous pathogens emerging and re-emerging disease is also a serious biosecurity concern the recent growth in containment laboratories is often in response to emerging diseases many new containment labs' main focus is to find ways to control these diseases by strengthening national disease surveillance prevention control and response systems these labs are raising international public health to new heights

communication between the citizen and law enforcement officials is imperative indicators of agroterrorism at a food processing plant may include persons taking notes or photos of a businesstheft of employee uniformsemployees changing working hoursor persons attempting to gain information about security measures and personnel unusual activity should be reported to law enforcement personnel promptly
communication between policymakers and life sciences scientists is also important

wind power in spain - wikipedia the free encyclopedia
spain is the world's second biggest producer of wind power in 2014 the year-end installed capacity was 23 gw and the annual production was 51,439 gwh a share of total electricity consumption of 21.1%
in 2009 for the first time in the annual calculation wind overtook coal that produced 33,844 gwh in 2010 43,692 gwh of wind electricity was produced in spain with an end of year installed capacity of over 20 gw representing 20% of capacity and 16% of production wind was the third biggest energy source in the country exceeded by thermal gas combined cycle at 68,828 gwh and nuclear that reached 61,944 gwh in 2010 wind energy covered 16% of the demand compared to 11.5% in 2008 and 13.8% in 2009
in 2009 the largest producer of wind power in spain was iberdrola with 25.5% of capacity followed by acciona with 20.9% and neo energia edp renewables with 8.3% on windy days wind power generation has surpassed all other electricity sources in spain in november 2009 a wind storm caused wind farms to produce a peak of 53% of total electricity demand 11.546 gw power peaks of 14.960 gw were reached in november 2010 and in november 2011 a new capacity peak of 59% of power demand being generated by wind power was reached on 6 february 2013 wind power achieved again a new record in electricity production reaching an instantaneous peak of 17,056 mw and an hourly production of 16,918 mwh
in 2015 0 mw of wind power was installed in spain


the intended wind energy capacity to be installed in the autonomous regions by 2010-2011 is 20,000 mw
the us rating agency standard & poors in a current investigation of standard of living in europe ranked navarre whose primary source of renewable energy is wind power uppermost among the 17 autonomous regions of spain navarre europe’s sixth largest producer of wind power currently sustains approximately 70 percent of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources wind farms being used most extensively and has a 900-megawatt capacity of installed wind power
navarre lacks thermal nuclear coal oil gas fields or hefty hydro-electric power stations but does possess considerable wind renewable resources which the government of navarre pursued to drop its external energy dependence navarre was entirely reliant on imported energy until wind-power development and utilization began progress in 1996
galicia currently leads in wind power development in the autonomous regions for the third consecutive year with an increase in wind power of 264 mw succeeding castilla la mancha which exceeded the development goal of 1000 mw and followed by aragon navarre and castile-león and the remaining autonomous regions castilla leon and la rioja have initiated wind energy production and the north-eastern area of soria also holds the capacity to be an efficient producer the possession of workable resources for wind power development is also represented in the cantabrian eastern and south-eastern coasts
largely concerned with advancing energy efficiency use in spain the institute for energy saving and diversification idae also seeks to expand renewable energy sources and energies
research concerning the production of hydrogen from electrolysis of water by a wind farm began in 2004 at a newly installed laboratory in the universidad pública de navarra under an agreement between energía hidroeléctrica de navarra stuart energy systems of canada and statkraft of norway the lab replicated the power generation environment of a wind farm and examined the effects of an electrolyzer
concentrated research is occurring concerning wind measurement in the albacete region at higueruela
the spanish wind energy sector now hosts the involvement of over 500 companies with approximately 150 wind turbine production plants and their machinery across the spanish regions the assets of the spanish industry are being noticed and acted upon by financial analysts as united states ernst and young in 2005 ranked the wind market in spain among the uppermost in its index of “long-term country attractiveness” including those indirectly employed in supplying components and services the total number of jobs supported by spain’s wind industry has reached more than 30 000 and is estimated to double to 60 000 by 2010” 2005
gamesa based in the basque country is a large global wind turbine manufacturer with 13% share by installed power in 2005 the company values the distinctive geographical setting of spain as a benefit to spanish companies competing in the global arena gamesa eólica currently operates plants in spain the us and china it has projects in many other parts of the world including egypt germany ireland italy japan korea and portugal gamesa opened a manufacturing plant for wind turbine generator blades in philadelphia pennsylvania in 2005 creating 500 part-time building and operations jobs and 236 permanent manufacturing jobs the building operation and upkeep of gamesa’s wind farms in conjunction with its two philadelphia offices and production plant formed about 1,000 jobs in the state over a five-year period the company seeks expansion into greece taiwan and the united kingdom
ecotècnia established 1981 and by 2005 had 2.1% world market share by installed capacity with wind turbines in production of up to 1.6mw in 2009 the company was acquired by alstom for €350million the company continued to develop wind turbines a 3mw machine was installed in a commercial windfarm in 2009 in 2010 the company was renamed alstom wind in 2011 2 the company developed a prototype 6mw permanent magnet gearless generator for offshore applications in association with lm wind power and converteam
acciona energy acciona energía the biggest global wind-park developer currently operates in australia canada france germany morocco spain and the united states the company credits its success to its initial stages in navarre during 1994 its line of work involves wind-farm operation turbine manufacture and the development of wind-power plants and the company intends to expand into china ireland and the united kingdom
iberdrola currently holds functioning facilities in brazil france greece italy mexico portugal spain the united states and the united kingdom and is continuing to develop wind farms in europe and latin america2
as of 2008 iberdrola plans to develop six offshore wind farm projects with a combined generation capacity of 3000 mw at locations off the coasts of the spanish atlantic provinces of cadiz huelva and the mediterranean province of castellon
mtorres initiated their activities in the wing energy field in 1998 with the launch of their newly developed wind turbine twt-1.5 70 a 1500 kw variable-speed direct-drive multipole wind turbine with a full-power converter and a 70 meters rotor diameter
the national spanish wind energy industry has begun to export its wind generators by forming contracts for the erection of wind farms in china india and mexico as well as cuba where work began in 1998 2007 they also have contracts at a highly developed stage with portugal turkey tunisia egypt brazil and argentina
the wind energy capacity for major companies in spain was the following as of 2007: gamesa eólica 3281 mw made 803 mw neg micon 715 mw ecotècnia 446 mw g electric 343 mw izar-bonus 317 mw desa & awp 121 mw enercon 58 mw lagerwey 38 mw and others 113 mw 2007
three factors will control the further progress of wind power development in spain: the capability of the wind farms network to hold all the electricity harnessed by wind power predominantly in off-peak times the cost of energy and the environmental effect that the abundance of wind farm development in spain could turn out the spanish wind power industry will be confronted with the following issues in the immediate future:
it is also noteworthy that the supportive spanish policies for wind power development have resulted in severe competition for construction sites among major companies political leaders in the autonomous communities have been frazzled by the numerous applications for wind farm construction local possession of wind power is not present in spain but does not appear to take aw
